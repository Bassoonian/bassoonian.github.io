<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Welcome to the homepage of <b>Carite</b>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages" target="_blank">Indo-European</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language" target="_blank">constructed language</a> made by Iasper and Darkgamma. What originally started as a small project the 29th of June, 2015, quickly grew into a widely praised feat, earning a rare purple flair on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/" target="_blank">/r/conlangs subreddit</a> two years into its existence with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/69ktl7/redefining_ielangs_introducing_carisitt/" target="_blank">a single post</a> and cementing its status of one of the longest living collaborations. Since then, it has undergone several reworks and is now widely considered to be one of the highest effort constructed languages ever made. Over the years, the responsibility of the constructed languageing work has slowly shifted from mostly Darkgamma (as Iasper was far too inexperienced still to carry any significant weight beyond aesthetic suggestions) to mostly Iasper, with this entire documentation and lexicon being assembled by the latter. Nonetheless, this language would not be what it is today without either.</p>
<h2>Practical notes</h2>
<h3>Presentaton</h3>
<p>Any piece of text besides this introductory page is presented as if in-universe. While a solid 90% of this does indeed correspond to what has happened in real life, anything that specifically pertains to the Carite people and their language is evidently fictional. Nonetheless, the greatest care has been taken to adhere as closely as possible to the laws of linguistics so that this language may hypothetically have existed today. Likewise, the early history has been preserved as intactly as possible - only in the early modern age are there any more significant changes to the course of history, which are once again as realistic as possible.</p>
<p>Besides being a hard science constructed language, with as many source references as possible, there is the occasional apparition of artistic liberty. More specifically, several words in the lexicon do not have any real etymology and are presented in-universe as being of unknown or of substrate origin - while this is also the case for many other branches, it is impossible to accurately reconstruct most Pre-Indo-European substrates (Pre-Greek being a very notable exception) and this feature thus provides a mostly realistic way of concealing artistic liberty. Nonetheless, when consulting the Sources tab of etymons that are not based on science, an alert will appear to inform the reader that any information mentioned in that specific entry is to be discarded in any potentially scientific research.</p>
<p>With each lexicon entry's etymology tab being as elaborate as possible, the Carite lexicon may also prove to be a useful compilation of many sources on Proto-Indo-European that are conveniently summarised and elaborated upon if necessary. Despite the ease of access, directly sourcing it as a source in academic contexts is highly discouraged due to the occasional fictional addition (even if these are explicitly marked as such) - however, each lexicon entry mentions a very specific page of the source used and includes links to facilitate lookups in fully trustworthy sources.</p>
<h3>Wiktionary links</h3>
<p>In each entry's etymology tab, links to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wiktionary</a> pages are included for cognates and etymologies. While these are included to give readers the opportunity to browse around, Wiktionary is a free resource and as such often inaccurate and/or incomplete. These links are automatically generated for your comfort and as such may link to non-existing pages. If this is the case, please refer to the bibliography tab for further reading.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://conlang.org" target="_blank">Language Creation Society (LCS)</a>, a constructed language <a href="http://conlang.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/Dentons-Conlang-Memo-public-version.pdf" target="_blank">may not be copyrighted</a>. However, anything that employs a constructed language may in fact be copyrighted - as such, this documentation, as well as this presentation of the lexicon (but not the actual vocabulary) is legally protected. This does not solely encompass the corpus you may read, but also the source code of the framework of this homepage. Any texts that are originally written in Carite are by extension also protected. However, you are free to employ Carite yourself and attain complete legal ownership of your creation. As much as we are unable to legally enforce this, we would very much appreciate a reference to this homepage, however.</p>
