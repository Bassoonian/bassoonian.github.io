<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Welcome to the homepage of <b>Carite</b>, an Indo-European conlang made by Iasper and Darkgamma. What originally started as a small project the 28th of May, 2015, quickly grew into a widely praised feat, earning a rare purple flair on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/" target="_blank">/r/conlangs subreddit</a> two years into its existence with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/69ktl7/redefining_ielangs_introducing_carisitt/" target="_blank">a single post</a> and cementing its status of one of the longest living collaborations. Since then, it has undergone several reworks and is now widely considered to be one of the highest effort conlangs ever made. Over the years, the responsibility of the conlanging work has slowly shifted from mostly Darkgamma (as Iasper was far too inexperienced still to carry any significant weight beyond aesthetic suggestions) to mostly Iasper, with this entire documentation and lexicon being assembled by the latter. Nonetheless, this language would not be what it is today without either.</p>
<h2>Practical notes</h2>
<p>Any piece of text besides this introductory page is presented as if in-universe. While a solid 90% of this does indeed correspond to what has happened in real life, anything that specifically pertains to the Carite people and their language is evidently fictional. Nonetheless, the greatest care has been taken to adhere as closely as possible to the laws of linguistics so that this language may hypothetically have existed today. Likewise, the early history has been preserved as intactly as possible - only in the early modern age are there any more significant changes to the course of history, which are once again as realistic as possible.</p>
<p>Besides being a hard science conlang, with as many source references as possible, there is the occasional apparition of artistic liberty. More specifically, several words in the lexicon do not have any real etymology and are presented in-universe as being of unknown or of substrate origin - while this is also the case for many other branches, it is impossible to accurately reconstruct most Pre-Indo-European substrates (Pre-Greek being a very notable exception) and this feature thus provides a mostly realistic way of concealing artistic liberty. Nonetheless, when consulting the Sources tab of etymons that are not based on science, an alert will appear to inform the reader that any information mentioned in that specific entry is to be discarded in any potentially scientific research.</p>
<p>With each lexicon entry's Etymology tab being as elaborate as possible, the Carite lexicon may also prove to be a useful compilation of many sources on Proto-Indo-European that are conveniently summarised and elaborated upon if necessary. Despite the ease of access, directly sourcing it as a source in academic contexts is highly discouraged due to the occasional fictional addition (even if these are explicitly marked as such) - however, each lexicon entry mentions a very specific page of the source used and includes links to facilitate lookups in fully trustworthy sources.</p>
