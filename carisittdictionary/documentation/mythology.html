<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Carite mythology has been extensively researched. A vast amount of inscriptions involve snippets of myths and some have been documented in other languages; an example includes a part of ??? being explained in vast detail in Tacitus' ???. Due to the limited scope of the Carite people, mythology was considered to be a vital part of their culture and identity and was held dearly. Nonetheless, due to extensive contact with other peoples and their religious beliefs, a significant portion of Carite mythology evolved over time, often incorporating foreign elements or replacing whole sections altogether. By the time of the Carite kingdom in the 12th century, Carite paganism flourished in stark contrast with the surrounding highly Christian kingdoms. The main written literature on the Carite pantheon and mythology dates from the existence of the kingdom. It is worth noting that several myths appear both in older inscriptions and in the monarchic attestations with actions and involved characters of not matching at all due to the influence of other religions (including Christianity) on the mythology.</p>
<h2>Deities</h2>
<h3>Major deities</h3>
<p>The major Carite deities may structered through a family tree:</p>
<h4>Sky Daddy</h4>
<h4>Earth Mummy</h4>
<h4>Sunny</h4>
<h4>Moony</h4>
<h4>€PERKUNAS</h4>
<p><b>°PERKUNAS</b> is the god of thunder, smiths, law and justice. Despite not being head of the pantheon, he very prevalently appears in a great amount of myths and plays a key role in many of the major stories; this may be attributed to his identity being a conflation of multiple older deities as well as his equation to lat@Iuppiter in later times. Details of his appearance vary but he is nearly always depicted with only a right arm (the loss of his left arm plays a pivotal role in the Discovery of Immortality).</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>After the conquest of the Carites, the importance of the Carite beliefs faded and Christianity quickly took over through <i>interpretatio christiana</i>. Traces of mythology remain in expressions, idioms and folkloric themes while several old deities had their name Latinised and were repainted as saints.</p>
