<h1>Mythology</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Carite mythology has been extensively researched. A vast amount of inscriptions involve snippets of myths and some have been documented in other languages; an example includes a part of ??? being explained in vast detail in Tacitus' ???. Due to the limited scope of the Carite people, mythology was considered to be a vital part of their culture and identity and was held dearly. Nonetheless, due to extensive contact with other peoples and their religious beliefs, a significant portion of Carite mythology evolved over time, often incorporating foreign elements or replacing whole sections altogether. By the time of the Carite kingdom in the 12th century, Carite paganism flourished in stark contrast with the surrounding highly Christian kingdoms. The main written literature on the Carite pantheon and mythology dates from the existence of the kingdom. It is worth noting that several myths appear both in older inscriptions and in the monarchic attestations with actions and involved characters of not matching at all due to the influence of other religions (including Christianity) on the mythology.</p>
<h2>Deities</h2>
<h3>Major deities</h3>
<p>The major Carite deities may structured through a family tree:</p>
<h4>€SKYDADDY€</h4>
<p><b>°SKYDADDY°</b> is the god of the sky and rain and forms a primary couple with °EARTHMUMMY°. Originally the head of the divine realm, his position was taken over by €SUNGOD€. Many of the original traits of the original heavenly father, <i>*Dyḗws Ph₂tḗr</i>, are no longer reflected in him and have presumably been taken over by the other gods, which significantly gained importance over the centuries. Nonetheless, his name and epiphets cleanly reflect this Indo-European origin.</p>
<p>°SKYDADDY° is mainly referred to in the Foundation War, with his importance having diminished significantly after.</p>
<h4>€EARTHMUMMY€</h4>
<p><b>°EARTHMUMMY°</b> is the goddess of the earth and agriculture. She is variably depicted as being €SKYDADDY€'s wife or consort - it is however notable that she is the mother of most of his children.</p>
<h4>€SUNGOD€</h4>
<p><b>°SUNGOD°</b> is the god of the sun and war and also functions as the pantheon's allfather after the theomachy depicted in the foundation war.</p>
<h4>€MOONGOD€</h4>
<p><b>°MOONGOD°</b> is the goddess of the moon, healing and the sea.</p>
<h4>€PERKUNAS€</h4>
<p><b>°PERKUNAS°</b> is the god of thunder, smiths, law and justice. Despite not being head of the pantheon, he very prevalently appears in a great amount of myths and plays a key role in many of the major stories; this may be attributed to his identity being a conflation of multiple older deities as well as his equation to lat@Iuppiter in later times. While details of his depiction vary, he is generally considered to be a middle aged man with a long beard. He stands out by only having a right arm (the loss of his left arm plays a pivotal role in the Discovery of Immortality).</p>
<p>€PERKUNAS€ appears to primarily be a conflation of two Indo-European deities: the god of thunder and the god of smiths. As the deity of thunder, he is painted as the protector of both gods and humans against evil. His association with oak trees, which he occasionally smites, is also of importance here and may have helped him get more important within the pantheon over time. His tendency to ride a car drawn by two goats, with the rumbling of his vehicle being the thunder, also appears to be inherited, just like his beard.</p>
<p>When it comes to his smith god heritage, a key part is his involvement in the creation of €SKYDADDY€'s weapon as well as his involvement in the immortals' drinking (see the Discovery of Immortality). If one considers the loss of his left arm as laming, we may also find parallels with grc@Ἥφαιστος=Hḗphaistos and the Germanic Wayland, though this may be a coincidence.</p>
<p>€PERKUNAS€'s signature hammer, the °LEGHAMMER°, is presumably the result of his storm god heritage (the lightning-shaped handle also points towards this) but may additionally be inforced by his status as the smith god, using it both for warfare and the crafting of weapons.</p>
<p>Besides his main occupation being the god of thunder and smiths, €PERKUNAS€ also appears to have some role when it comes to law and justice. For this reason, he is widely considered to also inherit Dumézil's First Function (juridical). The loss of his left arm would also reflect this inheritance.</p>

<h3>Discovery of Immortality</h3>
<p>As is common in the Indo-European tradition, deities are only immortal thanks to a specific food or beverage they consume. In Carite mythology, €PERKUNAS€ is tasked with finding the elusive °BLOODSERP°, a three-headed serpent known to be immortal. When he finds it at the bottom of a whirlpool, he binds it (to continue?)</p>
<p>From an Indo-European point of view, this myth appears to combine two essential myths: the serpent-slaying myth, in which a thunder god slays a serpent or dragon, and the binding of evil, in which a god inserts their hand into an evil being's orifice and losing it. Dumézil's "cycle of the mead" also seems to be relevant, with the magical beverage (being blood rather than mead here), the involvement of a serpent (what about the gods vs demons?).</p>
<h3>Rouma: Creation of the Stars</h3>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>After the conquest of the Carites, the importance of the Carite beliefs faded and Christianity quickly took over through <i>interpretatio christiana</i>. Traces of mythology remain in expressions, idioms and folkloric themes while several old deities had their name Latinised and were repainted as saints.</p>
