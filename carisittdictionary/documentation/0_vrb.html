<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<p>As is the case for nominals, Carite verbs appear to have gone a significant remodeling. Morphologically, this involves the regularisation of the thematic and athematic endings depending on the structure of the stem: when it ended on an obstruent, the verb behaved according the thematic conjugation; otherwise, it behaved according to the athematic conjugation which developed two subclasses: one for stems ending on a bare vowel and one for stems ending on a sonorant. The copula is noteworthily an exception here - the regular remodeling would have resulted in a thematic inflection, but this does not appear to be the case. It is worth noting that this also affects many of the derivational suffixes, although to different degrees - for example, the causative suffix <i>*-éye-</i> appears to be continued as <i>*-éymi</i>. I-presents appear to be the only exception, with both the original form co-existing next to the reanalysed <i>*-imi</i> - a possible explanation for this may be the common reanalyses that took place where the i-stem form was reanalysed as the stem and the cluster may have prevented the remodeling as an athematic inflection from occurring.</p>
<p>The second important innovation is the split of the mediopassive voice into a separate paradigm - more importantly, it became the go-to inflection class for intransitive verbs. The consensus is that this is a narrowing of the middle voice used to convey: after all, the passive voice is conveyed analytically already in §lang_0. These intransitive classes partake in the same thematic/athematic distinctions as described above. It is worth noting that this appeared to be a rather late development, with many intransitive verbs continuing to take transitive suffixes.</p>
<p>In the indicative, §lang_0 reflects three tenses: present, preterite and future. The present tense continues the primary endings while the secondary endings are reflected in the preterite; noteworthily, it also features the augment <i>*h₁e</i> as prefix. The future tense appears to continue the desiderative suffix <i>*-(h₁)s-</i>. As in Proto-Indo-European, the laryngeal was generally dropped when attached to a stem ending on an obstruent, functioning as a root derivation. On top of this, the fact this desiderative suffix was generally followed by <i>*-y-</i> must have led to the presence of the optative suffixes we find in §lang_0. The subjunctive only reflected two tenses, being non-past and past. The original Proto-Indo-European consisted of the addition of an extra thematic vowel before the primary suffix, causing long vowels in thematic inflections and forms identical to thematic indicatives in the athematic inflections; this was continued in the non-past subjunctive with the past subjunctive coming into existence through analogy, applying the same principle to the secondary endings. The addition of these thematic vowels to otherwise athematic verbs caused many athematic vocalic verbs to have slightly different subjunctive stems as this blocked the collapse of many diphthongs.</p>
<p>On top of this, Carite features an imperative for the second person singular as well as the first and second persons plural, which partially developed from the optative as discussed below. The two participles, commonly referred to as present and past, don't carry actual tense connotations when used grammatically; rather, they are marked for concurrentness with the main verb. These are widely used, replacing full relative clauses and having a semipredicative nature. Worth noting is the presence of the augment in the past participle. The present participle inflects according to the radical iotic inflection while the past participle adheres to the oxytonic thematic paradigm. Curiously, like Proto-Celtic, §lang_0 did not appear to possess any infinitive formations.</p>
<h2>Transitive conjugations</h2>
<h3>Thematic</h3>
||TABLE-OH2_DEF||
<p>In the indicative, the thematic conjugation cleanly continues the primary and secondary endings - including the thematic vowels, evidently. More specifically, in the singular, these are <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ω (-ō), Latin -ō"><i>*-oh₂</i></span>, <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -εις (-eis)"><i>*-esi</i></span> and <i>*-eti</i> for the present and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. ancient Greek -ον (-on)"><i>*-om</i></span>, <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ες (-es)"><i>*-es</i></span> and <i>-et</i> for the past. In the first person plural, we find the original <i>*-omos</i> preserved in the present next to the original <i>*-ome</i> in the past; while <i>*-ete</i> was originally both the primary and secondary ending for the second person plural, Carite appears to have innovated the present form by importing <i>*-os</i> from the first personal plural. The third person plural is once again a regular reflex, showcasing <i>*-onti</i> in the present and <i>*-ont</i> in the past. In the subjunctive forms, we find the identical suffixes but with a lengthened thematic vowel - the only exceptions here are the third personal plural endings, which would have violated Osthoff's law if they had been lengthened. It is worth noting that the distribution of the thematic vowels, like Greek, Latin and Germanic, neatly reflects Proto-Indo-Europeans without any disturbance.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the future seems to be built off the desiderative suffix <i>*-(h₁)s-</i> followed by an optative marker. In Proto-Indo-European, this was the ablauting <i>*-yeh₁- ~ *-ih₁-</i> in athematic constructions and <i>*-oy-</i> in thematic constructions (at least for Greek, Germanic, Baltic and Indo-Iranian). It is not entirely clear if Carite continues a generalisation of <i>*-ih₁-</i> or of <i>*-eyh₁-</i>, which would be a metathesis of <i>*-yeh₁-</i> based on the thematic marker. The <i>*-ā-</i> present in Italo-Celtic is unrelated. On top of this optative marker, we may find the secondary athematic suffixs, which are discussed below in further detail. It is worth noting that many future forms have derivating future stems due to the interaction with consonants and the <i>*-s-</i> suffix - as a general rule, we may posit that any root-final dental plosive turned into <i>*-s-</i> as well (<i>*s</i> would have been deleted under Proto-Indo-European phonotactics), but other alterations may be more unexpected or irregular - for example, roots on *-φ (<i>*-f</i>) and *-ϝ (<i>*-v</i>) have a future in *-σν- (<i>*-sm-</i>); if this is preceded by a nasal, the outcome is *-μμ- (</i>*-mm-</i>).</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the <i>*-oy</i> of the thematic constructions as presented above is continued in the imperative, where it precedes the typical imperative suffixes. Rather than the second and third person imperatives Proto-Indo-European had at its disposal, §lang_0 only appears to have continued the second person while innovating a new first person plural imperative. As such, we find <i>*-∅</i> and <i>*-te</i> for the second person singular and plural, respectively. With the plural suffix being identical to the secondary second person plural suffix, the innovation of attaching the secondary first person plural suffix <i>*-me</i> is trivial.</p>
<p>The original active present participle <i>*-onts ~ *-nt-</i> appears to have been continued only in the zero grade, which most likely was the form it occurred in the most. As mentioned before, consonant stems were remodeled as i-stems, resulting in a Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-n̥tis</i>, with the syllabic nasal being the result of all thematic nouns ending on an obstruent. As discussed in further detail below, §lang_0 may have had a variant in *-υν- (<i>*-un-</i>) following labial and labiodental consonants, but this has left no further trace. The past participle, which carries a mildly passive connotation and is also used periphrastically to denote the passive, has its origins in the original <i>*-tós</i>. In Proto-Indo-European times, this was attached directly to the zero grade of the root - in Carite, however, not only is it attached to the ablaut grade that appears in the rest of the paradigm, an extra thematic vowel <i>*-o-</i> is inserted before. The stress most definitely remained suffixal as can be inferred from its oxytonic inflection paradigm and the effects of Verner's Carite Law.</p>
<h3>Athematic Resonantal</h3>
||TABLE-MI_RES_DEF||
<p>As any reader with elementary knowledge of the Proto-Indo-European verbal system already knows, the athematic endings almost entirely matched the thematic suffixes, with the primary difference being a lack of thematic vowel. As such, we find most of the developments in the thematic paradigm here as well. The first person singular endings, however, were <i>*-mi</i> and <i>*-m̥</i> instead. Proto-Indo-European had two different endings for the third person plural, i.e. one with a stressed vowel <i>*-ént(i)</i> and one without, yielding a zero grade after consonants, i.e. <i>*-n̥t(i)</i>. As we will also see in the vocalic table below, Carite appears to have regularised the zero grade form, presumably at a similar point in time as the abolishment of ablaut (the copula, as discussed below, is an exception). In most cases, this syllabic nasal gave rise to the sequence *-ιν- (<i>*-in-</i>) in §lang_0 - however, it is likely that for a longer period of time (and perhaps even up until §lang_0?), a variant in *-υν- (<i>*-un-</i>) also existed after roots on *-μ (<i>*-m</i>). Either way, this form must have been lost in later times as we find no trace of it in later attestations. The subjunctive inserts a thematic vowel, yielding the same forms as the thematic indicative. We will find that this will have a profound effect on the stems in the vocalic equivalent but in the resonantal inflection, such alternations only seldomly occurs. An example of such exception is °WERMI° (< pie@wérti) - the sequence <i>*we</i> collapsed into <i>*ē</i> which was subsequently shortened by Osthoff's Law, which applied to all indicative forms (except the third person plural forms, although it may have been applied here through analogy too) but to none of the subjunctive forms, where it remained long. This long vowel was eventually raised to <i>*ī</i>, yielding the alteration it has right now.</p>
<p>In the future, we find endings identical to those in the thematic paradigm, with the exception that the laryngeal <i>*h₁</i> was retained. As a result, for the resonantal athematics we find a stem identical to the subjunctive stem in the future forms.</p>
<p>In the imperative, we once again find the originally thematic optative marker <i>*-oy</i> - as such, we may posit that the originally athematic marker was generalised across the board for future purposes while originally thematic marker was generalised for imperative purposes. The actual endings are identical to those found in the thematic paradigm - as a result of this vowel-initial suffix, we also find the subjunctive stem in imperative usage.</p>
<p>For the participles, we find an identical Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-n̥tis</i> for the present - likewise, there may have been a *-υ- (<i>*-u-</i>) vocalism in roots ending on a labial. We also find a reflex of <i>*-tós</i> for the past participle.</p>
<h3>Athematic Vocalic</h3>
||TABLE-MI_VOC_DEF||
<p>The vocalic athematic transitive paradigm is mostly identical to the resonantal one, with the exception that the syllabic nasals were non-syllabic. As briefly mentiond before, almost all vocalic athematic verbs have a separate subjunctive stem, which originates from two possible scenarios. The first is that diphthongs in a coda position collapsed - this means that e.g. <i>*we</i> collapsed into <i>*ē</i> preconsonantally, but was retained as such prevocalically as is the case in the subjunctive forms. The other scenario is that short vowels followed by a laryngeal were lengthened if not followed by another vowel - as such, we may find long vowels that appear in their short equivalents in the subjunctive. It is also worth noting that in the third person plural in the indicative, Osthoff's law remains in effect, shortening any long vowel that may have been there.</p>
<p>What makes this paradigm even more complicated, is the fact that yet another stem appears in the future - here, it is the result of the original stem before the diphthong collapse possibly being lengthened due to the desiderative laryngeal. In most cases, however, this is identical to the present/preterite stem. The imperative, as in the resonantal paradigm, employs the subjunctive stem.</p>
<p>In the participles, we find a continuation of Pre-§lang_0 <i>*ntis</i> in the present, shortening any long vowels through Osthoff's Law as is the case for many third person plural forms, and a continuation of <i>*-tós</i> in the past.</p>
<h2>Intransitive conjugations</h2>
<h3>Thematic</h3>
||TABLE-OR_DEF||
<p>The intransitive paradigm contains considerably more innovations - strong influence from the old active (now transitive) paradigm is not exclusive to Carite, but happened in most if not all branches to some degree. While the first and third person singular neatly reflect <i>*-oh₂o(r)</i> and <i>*-eto(r)</i>, respectively, where the rhotic is missing in the past forms, we find <i>*-s-</i> rather than <i>*-t-</i> in the second person, which is either adopted from the active paradigm or, less likely, from the imperative suffix and may have gained traction due to the inevitable merger of <i>*-eth₂o(r)</i> and <i>*-eto(r)</i> - it is unknown if the laryngeal was analogised away as well. The original formation of the first person plural, which consisted of the active endings plus <i>*-dʰh₂</i>, were reformed in a manner similar but not identical to Italic and Celtic: the <i>*-r</i> typical of the middle voice replaced the final consonant in the primary endings, i.e. <i>*-omor</i> rather than <i>*-omos</i>, with the past ending deriving from this but dropping the <i>*-r</i>, as is the case for the other forms. The second person plural endings, in contrast, appear to continue the suffix <i>*-edʰwe ~ *-edʰwo</i>, although it appears that, as in the transitive conjugations, influence from the first person plural endings occurred as in Carite, they appear to continue <i>*-edʰwor</i> and <i>*-edʰwo</i> for present and past, respectively. The third person plural thematic vowel is often reconstructed as <i>*e</i> in the middle voice in Proto-Indo-European, in which case the reflex of <i>*o</i> would be a result of analogy with the old active paradigm. As above, we find identical forms but with a lengthened thematic vowel for the subjunctive - once again, Osthoff's law would have either prevented or undone the lengthening in the third person plural.</p>
<p>It is unknown to which degree the intransitive future forms are original, but they seem to be largely based on the transitive future forms - as such, <i>*-sih₁-</i> was attached to the stem, followed by the secondary endings. The reflex of the first person singular form is slightly puzzling as one would expect *-ῐο (<i>*-jo</i>) - it is unknown if the length (and, as a result, the syllabicity) is through analogy with the other suffixes or if the structure <i>*-VHH-</i> would in fact have lengthened the vowel, even though this would most likely have broken the phonotactics at the time.</p>
<p>As in the transitive paradigms, we find the optative marker <i>*-oy</i> followed by the original middle voice imperative suffixes, i.e. <i>*-so</i> and <i>*-dʰwe</i> - as in the transitive conjugations, the imperative second person plural suffix is identical to its secondary equivalent, facilitating the adoption of the first person plural suffix for innovation purposes.</p>
<p>The present participle for intransitives appears to continue <i>*-o-mnos</i> (reconstructions with <i>*-mh₁n-</i> rather than <i>*-men-</i> are incompatible not just with Carite, but also with Indo-Iranian). This contrasts with Greek, which preserves the full grade instead (cf. grc@-μενος=-menos). Its past equivalent appears to be a conflation of the present participle and <i>*-tós</i>, also found in the transitive conjugations, as it appears to depart from a Pre-§lang_0 <i>**-omn̥tós</i>.</p>
<h2>Copula</h2>
||TABLE-COPULA||
<p>The copula is particularly archaic in its conjugation, not just displaying the original athematic endings on a root ending on a consonant, but also being the sole retainer of the original ablaut. Additionally, it is suppletive.</p>
<p>In the present indicative, we find the usual athematic endings attached to pie@h₁es- in the singular, with the second person reflecting <i>**-ssi</i> which was regularly degeminated through Proto-Indo-European phonotactics. In the plural forms, we find the zero grade which is curiously enough followed by a thematic vowel - this may explain why we find <i>*o</i> rather than <i>*e</i> in the third person plural. We find the same principles as outlined above in the subjunctive, where the singular receives a thematic vowel (and, as a result, thematic suffixes) while the plural forms receive another thematic vowel, which effectively lengthens it. The outcome is slightly different from the regular outcome due to the stressed vowel raising.</p>
<p>In the preterite, we find a continuation of pie@bʰuhₓ- instead (notably, without ablaut) which follows the expected athematic vocalic suffixes in both indicative and subjunctive. It is worth noting that these forms may or may not have had an initial augment.</p>
<p>In the future, we once again find reflexes of <i>*h₁es-</i>. In the singular, we find a stem identical to the present (presumably due to geminate </i>**-ss-</i> being simplified back in Proto-Indo-European) while in the plural, we curiously may reconstruct a stem departing from the present forms where, as in the subjunctive, the thematic vowel was reanalysed as being part of the stem. The imperative forms are more straightforward and line up better with what we have seen before.</p>
<p>For the participles, we find a variant of the Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-n̥tis</i> we find in other paradigms, being the original <i>*-onts</i> preceded by the zero grade of <i>*h₁es-</i>. It is likely this <i>*-o</i> - which was not a thematic vowel - was similarly reanalysed as belonging to the stem, at which point the usual athematic suffix could be added. The past participle consists of the preterite stem and the <i>*-tós</i> suffix.</p>
