<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Development</h2>
<h3>Thematicity Morphologisation</h3>
<p>As is the case for nominals, Carite verbs appear to have gone a significant remodeling. Morphologically, this involves the regularisation of the thematic and athematic endings depending on the structure of the stem: when it ended on an obstruent, the verb behaved according the thematic conjugation; otherwise, it behaved according to the athematic conjugation which developed two subclasses: one for stems ending on a bare vowel and one for stems ending on a sonorant. The copula is noteworthily an exception here - the regular remodeling would have resulted in a thematic inflection, but this does not appear to be the case. It is worth noting that this also affects many of the derivational suffixes, although to different degrees - for example, the causative suffix <i>*-éye-</i> appears to be continued as <i>*-éymi</i>. I-presents appear to be the only exception - a possible explanation for this may be the common reanalyses that took place where the i-stem form was reanalysed as the stem and the cluster may have prevented the remodeling as an athematic inflection from occurring; alternatively, the widespread oxytonic accentuation in <i>*-yéti</i> may have helped to preserve the thematic vowel, also in forms where such a formation had radical stress.</p>
<h3>Mediopassive Split</h3>
<p>The second important innovation is the split of the mediopassive voice into a separate paradigm - more importantly, it became the go-to inflection class for intransitive verbs. The consensus is that this is a narrowing of the middle voice used to convey: after all, the passive voice is conveyed analytically already in §lang_0. These intransitive classes partake in the same thematic/athematic distinctions as described above. It is worth noting that this appeared to be a rather late development, with many intransitive verbs continuing to take transitive suffixes.</p>
<h3>Stative retention</h3>
<p>As in branches such as Greek and Germanic, the Proto-Indo-European stative slowly started acquiring a perfect connotation. While this was used extensively in the aforementioned branches, providing the past forms of strong Germanic verbs and a plethora of perfects in Ancient Greek, this process was largely confined to a limited group of verbs, in which the preterite was conveyed using an old stative. Like Greek and Indo-Iranian, Carite innovated a new mediopassive stative by appending the primary eventive endings to the weak grade of the stem. The reduplicated pattern employed - <i>*(e)-(ó)-</i> for actives and <i>*(e)-(Ø)-´-</i> for mediopassives, that is - was in all likelihood already fossilised by the time of §lang_0. In roots of the <i>#HV-</i> shape that yielded a sequence of Pre-§lang_0 <i>*eV-</i> lost the initial vowel - this was most likely reanalysed as an erroneous augment, which was not used in statives. Verbs loaned from Ancient Greek, despite possibly possessing perfects of identical formation, received regular preterite treatment in Carite usage.</p>
<h3>Root-final laryngeals</h3>
<p>If a root ended on <i>*-CH-</i> (and thus received the thematic treatment), it appears the laryngeal colouring did not affect the thematic suffix - if it did at some point, it must have been analogised away early enough. The same notably happens in future tenses, where the addition of the desiderative <i>*-s-</i> (see below) would expectedly cause the laryngeal in a <i>*-CHs-</i> environment to vocalise; however, the laryngeal is not reflected anywhere, presumably through analogy with the present stem. This loss of root-final laryngeals when following obstruents must predate thematicity morphologisation as roots ending on <i>*-RH-</i> were analysed as <i>*-R-</i> and regularly received the athematic treatment.</p>
<h2>Tense-Aspect-Mood</h2>
<h3>Indicative</h3>
<p>In the indicative, §lang_0 reflects three tenses: present, preterite and future. The present tense continues the primary endings while the secondary endings are reflected in the preterite; noteworthily, it also features the augment <i>*h₁e</i> as prefix. The future tense appears to continue the desiderative suffix <i>*-(h₁)s-</i>. As in Proto-Indo-European, the laryngeal was generally dropped when attached to a stem ending on an obstruent, functioning as a root derivation. On top of this, the fact this desiderative suffix was generally followed by <i>*-y-</i> must have led to the presence of the optative suffixes we find in §lang_0.</p>
<h3>Subjunctive</h3>
<p>The subjunctive only reflected two tenses, being non-past and past. The original Proto-Indo-European consisted of the addition of an extra thematic vowel before the primary suffix, causing long vowels in thematic inflections and forms identical to thematic indicatives in the athematic inflections; this was continued in the non-past subjunctive with the past subjunctive coming into existence through analogy, applying the same principle to the secondary endings. The addition of these thematic vowels to otherwise athematic verbs caused many athematic vocalic verbs to have slightly different subjunctive stems as this blocked the collapse of many diphthongs.</p>
<h3>Imperative</h3>
<p>On top of this, Carite features an imperative for the second person singular as well as the first and second persons plural, which partially developed from the optative as discussed below.</p>
<h3>Participles</h3>
<p>The two participles, commonly referred to as present and past, don't carry actual tense connotations when used grammatically; rather, they are marked for concurrentness with the main verb. These are widely used, replacing full relative clauses and having a semipredicative nature. The present participle inflects according to the radical iotic inflection while the past participle adheres to the oxytonic thematic paradigm.</p>
<h3>Infinitive</h3>
<p>Curiously, like Proto-Celtic, §lang_0 did not appear to possess any infinitive formation.</p>
<h2>Paradigms</h2>
<p>The different verbal inflection patterns in §lang_0 are most often referred to through the Proto-Indo-European terms they descend from. As explained before, we may split all paradigms into two categories, i.e. thematic conjugations as opposed to athematic conjugations. We may note a further minor division in the athematic conjugation based on whether the stem ended on a vowel or on a resonant. Within the thematic and athematic categories, we may distinguish further between transitive conjugations - that is, the old active voice - and the intransitive conjugations - that is, the old mediopassive voice.</p>
<p>The thematic conjugations feature a minor variant where some suffixes slightly differ; this is widely referred to as the zeta variant after the future surfacing as <i>*-z-</i>; more on that below.</p>
<h2>Transitive conjugations</h2>
<h3>Thematic</h3>
||TABLE-OH2_DEF||
<p>In the indicative, the thematic conjugation cleanly continues the primary and secondary endings - including the thematic vowels, evidently. More specifically, in the singular, these are <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ω (-ō), Latin -ō"><i>*-oh₂</i></span>, <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -εις (-eis)"><i>*-esi</i></span> and <i>*-eti</i> for the present and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. ancient Greek -ον (-on)"><i>*-om</i></span>, <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ες (-es)"><i>*-es</i></span> and <i>-et</i> for the past. In the first person plural, we find the original <i>*-omos</i> preserved in the present next to the original <i>*-ome</i> in the past; while <i>*-ete</i> was originally both the primary and secondary ending for the second person plural, Carite appears to have innovated the present form by importing <i>*-os</i> from the first personal plural. The third person plural is once again a regular reflex, showcasing <i>*-onti</i> in the present and <i>*-ont</i> in the past. In the subjunctive forms, we find the identical suffixes but with a lengthened thematic vowel - the only exceptions here are the third personal plural endings, which would have violated Osthoff's law if they had been lengthened. It is worth noting that the distribution of the thematic vowels, like Greek, Latin and Germanic, neatly reflects Proto-Indo-Europeans without any disturbance.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the future seems to be built off the desiderative suffix <i>*-(h₁)s-</i> followed by an optative marker. In Proto-Indo-European, this was the ablauting <i>*-yeh₁- ~ *-ih₁-</i> in athematic constructions and <i>*-oy-</i> in thematic constructions (at least for Greek, Germanic, Baltic and Indo-Iranian). It is not entirely clear if Carite continues a generalisation of <i>*-ih₁-</i> or of <i>*-eyh₁-</i>, which would be a metathesis of <i>*-yeh₁-</i> based on the thematic marker. The <i>*-ā-</i> present in Italo-Celtic is unrelated. On top of this optative marker, we may find the secondary athematic suffixs, which are discussed below in further detail. It is worth noting that many future forms have derivating future stems due to the interaction with consonants and the <i>*-s-</i> suffix - as a general rule, we may posit that any root-final dental plosive turned into <i>*-s-</i> as well (an original <i>*s-s</i> would have been reduced to <i>*s</i> under Proto-Indo-European phonotactics); a few show an alteration of *-σ- ~ *-σσ- (<i>*-s- ~ *-ss-</i>), but this is only the case if departing from an original <i>*-ty-</i>), but other alterations may be more unexpected or irregular - for example, roots on *-φ (<i>*-f</i>) and *-θ (<i>*-v</i>) have a future in *-σμ- (<i>*-sm-</i>); if this is preceded by a nasal, the outcome is *-μμ- (</i>*-mm-</i>).</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the <i>*-oy</i> of the thematic constructions as presented above is continued in the imperative, where it precedes the typical imperative suffixes. Rather than the second and third person imperatives Proto-Indo-European had at its disposal, §lang_0 only appears to have continued the second person while innovating a new first person plural imperative. As such, we find <i>*-∅</i> and <i>*-te</i> for the second person singular and plural, respectively. With the plural suffix being identical to the secondary second person plural suffix, the innovation of attaching the secondary first person plural suffix <i>*-me</i> is trivial.</p>
<p>The original active present participle <i>*-onts ~ *-nt-</i> appears to have been continued only in the zero grade, which most likely was the form it occurred in the most. As mentioned before, consonant stems were remodeled as i-stems, resulting in a Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-n̥tis</i>, with the syllabic nasal being the result of all thematic nouns ending on an obstruent. As discussed in further detail below, §lang_0 may have had a variant in *-υν- (<i>*-un-</i>) following labial and labiodental consonants, but this has left no further trace. The past participle, which carries a mildly passive connotation and is also used periphrastically to denote the passive, has its origins in the original <i>*-tós</i>. In Proto-Indo-European times, this was attached directly to the zero grade of the root - in Carite, however, not only is it attached to the ablaut grade that appears in the rest of the paradigm, an extra thematic vowel <i>*-o-</i> is inserted before. We would expect <i>*e</i> to be the thematic vowel here; it is widely regarded to be influence of the uninherited participle <i>*-o-nos</i>. The stress most definitely remained suffixal as can be inferred from its oxytonic inflection paradigm and the effects of Verner's Carite Law.</p>
<h4>Zeta variants</h4>
||TABLE-OH2_DEF_SUF||
<p>A small relic subgroup of these thematic transitives, called zeta-variants after the future surfacing as <i>*-z-</i>, has slightly different suffixes. These are all the result of the stressed raising of long mid vowels, as well as Verner's Carite Law. The u-colouring of the subjunctive third person plurals is presumably the result of analogy.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
||TABLE-OH2_DEF_PFP||
<p>As discussed before, some verbs inherited a stative as their preterite. In the singular, we find the original <i>*-h₂e</i> suffixed with the secondary <i>*-m</i> for the first person; the third person likewise inherited <i>*-e</i> extended with the secondary <i>*-t</i>. The evolution of the second person suffix is slightly more complicated. Based on evidence from Greek and Latin among others, it is often reconstructed as <i>*-th₂e</i>, which with its theoretical **-τα (<i>**-ta</i>) differs significantly from what we find in §lang_0. The loss of the dental and its extension with the secondary <i>*-s</i> is relatively straightforward, however, and is parallelled in Greek. In the plural, the original suffixes of the first and second person were identical to the secondary endings and it seems that in Carite, the secondary third person ending was likewise adopted for statives. It is worth noting that these three are separated from their stem with an additional thematic vowel. As a result, all suffixes except for the first and second person singular are identical to the regular preterite endings. The similarity of the endings to the preterite has also led to the innovated subjunctive forms, which, like regular preterites, consist of lengthened thematic vowels - in the case of the first and second person singular, the vowel of different origin that occupies the same slot is analogically lengthened. This must have occurred relatively late as the colouring of <i>*h₂ē</i> would be isolated.</p>
<h3>Athematic Resonantal</h3>
||TABLE-MI_RES_DEF||
<p>As any reader with elementary knowledge of the Proto-Indo-European verbal system already knows, the athematic endings almost entirely matched the thematic suffixes, with the primary difference being a lack of thematic vowel. As such, we find most of the developments in the thematic paradigm here as well. The first person singular endings, however, were <i>*-mi</i> and <i>*-m̥</i> instead. Proto-Indo-European had two different endings for the third person plural, i.e. one with a stressed vowel <i>*-ént(i)</i> and one without, yielding a zero grade after consonants, i.e. <i>*-n̥t(i)</i>. As we will also see in the vocalic table below, Carite appears to have regularised the zero grade form, presumably at a similar point in time as the abolishment of ablaut (the copula, as discussed below, is an exception). In most cases, this syllabic nasal gave rise to the sequence *-ιν- (<i>*-in-</i>) in §lang_0 - however, it is likely that for a longer period of time (and perhaps even up until §lang_0?), a variant in *-υν- (<i>*-un-</i>) also existed after roots on *-μ (<i>*-m</i>). Either way, this form must have been lost in later times as we find no trace of it in later attestations. The subjunctive inserts a thematic vowel, yielding the same forms as the thematic indicative. We will find that this will have a profound effect on the stems in the vocalic equivalent but in the resonantal inflection, such alternations only seldomly occurs. An example of such exception is °SEMMI° (< pie@swén(h₂)mi) - the sequence <i>*we</i> collapsed into <i>*ē</i> which was subsequently shortened by Osthoff's Law, which applied to all indicative forms (except the third person plural forms, although it may have been applied here through analogy too) but to none of the subjunctive forms, where it remained long. This long vowel was eventually raised to <i>*ī</i>, yielding the alteration it has right now.</p>
<p>In the future, we find endings identical to those in the thematic paradigm, with the exception that the laryngeal <i>*h₁</i> was retained. As a result, for the resonantal athematics we find a stem identical to the subjunctive stem in the future forms.</p>
<p>In the imperative, we once again find the originally thematic optative marker <i>*-oy</i> - as such, we may posit that the originally athematic marker was generalised across the board for future purposes while originally thematic marker was generalised for imperative purposes. The actual endings are identical to those found in the thematic paradigm - as a result of this vowel-initial suffix, we also find the subjunctive stem in imperative usage.</p>
<p>For the participles, we find an identical Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-n̥tis</i> for the present - likewise, there may have been a *-υ- (<i>*-u-</i>) vocalism in roots ending on a labial. We also find a reflex of <i>*-tós</i> for the past participle.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
||TABLE-MI_RES_DEF_PFP||
<p>For the largest part, the stative endings for athematic resonantals match the ones discussed above (and, in the plural, the regular athematic resonantal preterites). In the indicative, we find the retention of the original dental in the second person singular. In the subjunctive, we find the insertion of a thematic vowel before the suffixes found in the indicative. As a result, while the plural suffixes are a carbon copy of the indicative thematic endings, the singular forms would logically have resulted into different forms. As the expected thematic vowel for the first person singular would be <i>*-o-</i>, we would expect **-οα (<i>**-oa</i>); the long alpha we find may point towards analogy with the thematic ending or to a thematic vowel of <i>*-e-</i>, as the sequence <i>*-eh₂e</i> would regularly yield this long vowel. In the second person, we again find the retention of the dental while the long vowel in the third person is likewise regular (from <i>**-e-e</i>).</p>
<h3>Athematic Vocalic</h3>
||TABLE-MI_VOC_DEF||
<p>The vocalic athematic transitive paradigm is mostly identical to the resonantal one, with the exception that the syllabic nasals were non-syllabic. As briefly mentiond before, almost all vocalic athematic verbs have a separate subjunctive stem, which originates from two possible scenarios. The first is that diphthongs in a coda position collapsed - this means that e.g. <i>*we</i> collapsed into <i>*ē</i> preconsonantally, but was retained as such prevocalically as is the case in the subjunctive forms. The other scenario is that short vowels followed by a laryngeal were lengthened if not followed by another vowel - as such, we may find long vowels that appear in their short equivalents in the subjunctive. It is also worth noting that in the third person plural in the indicative, Osthoff's law remains in effect, shortening any long vowel that may have been there.</p>
<p>What makes this paradigm even more complicated, is the fact that yet another stem appears in the future - here, it is the result of the original stem before the diphthong collapse possibly being lengthened due to the desiderative laryngeal. In most cases, however, this is identical to the present/preterite stem. The imperative, as in the resonantal paradigm, employs the subjunctive stem.</p>
<p>In the participles, we find a continuation of Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-ntis</i> in the present, shortening any long vowels through Osthoff's Law as is the case for many third person plural forms, and a continuation of <i>*-tós</i> in the past.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
||TABLE-MI_VOC_DEF_PFP||
<p>With up to four distinct stems, the few athematic vocalic verbs with a stative preterite have perhaps the most complicated paradigm. The stative stem, like the present stem, possesses a secondary subjunctive stem, which is additionally employed in some indicative forms. Besides this anomaly, the endings are identical to the athematic resonantal endings.</p>
<h2>Intransitive conjugations</h2>
<h3>Thematic</h3>
||TABLE-OR_DEF||
<p>The intransitive paradigm contains considerably more innovations - strong influence from the old active (now transitive) paradigm is not exclusive to Carite, but happened in most if not all branches to some degree. While the first and third person singular neatly reflect <i>*-oh₂o(r)</i> and <i>*-eto(r)</i>, respectively, where the rhotic is missing in the past forms, we find <i>*-s-</i> rather than <i>*-t-</i> in the second person, which is either adopted from the active paradigm or, less likely, from the imperative suffix and may have gained traction due to the inevitable merger of <i>*-eth₂o(r)</i> and <i>*-eto(r)</i> - it is unknown if the laryngeal was analogised away as well. The original formation of the first person plural, which consisted of the active endings plus <i>*-dʰh₂</i>, were reformed in a manner similar but not identical to Italic and Celtic: the <i>*-r</i> typical of the middle voice replaced the final consonant in the primary endings, i.e. <i>*-omor</i> rather than <i>*-omos</i>, with the past ending deriving from this but dropping the <i>*-r</i>, as is the case for the other forms. The second person plural endings, in contrast, appear to continue the suffix <i>*-edʰwe ~ *-edʰwo</i>, although it appears that, as in the transitive conjugations, influence from the first person plural endings occurred as in Carite, they appear to continue <i>*-edʰwor</i> and <i>*-edʰwo</i> for present and past, respectively. The third person plural thematic vowel is often reconstructed as <i>*e</i> in the middle voice in Proto-Indo-European, in which case the reflex of <i>*o</i> would be a result of analogy with the old active paradigm. As above, we find identical forms but with a lengthened thematic vowel for the subjunctive - once again, Osthoff's law would have either prevented or undone the lengthening in the third person plural.</p>
<p>It is unknown to which degree the intransitive future forms are original, but they seem to be largely based on the transitive future forms - as such, <i>*-sih₁-</i> was attached to the stem, followed by the secondary endings. The reflex of the first person singular form is slightly puzzling as one would expect *-ῐο (<i>*-jo</i>) - it is unknown if the length (and, as a result, the syllabicity) is through analogy with the other suffixes or if the structure <i>*-VHH-</i> would in fact have lengthened the vowel, even though this would most likely have broken the phonotactics at the time.</p>
<p>As in the transitive paradigms, we find the optative marker <i>*-oy</i> followed by the original middle voice imperative suffixes, i.e. <i>*-so</i> and <i>*-dʰwe</i> - as in the transitive conjugations, the imperative second person plural suffix is identical to its secondary equivalent, facilitating the adoption of the first person plural suffix for innovation purposes.</p>
<p>The present participle for intransitives appears to continue <i>*-o-mnos</i> (reconstructions with <i>*-mh₁n-</i> rather than <i>*-men-</i> are incompatible not just with Carite, but also with Indo-Iranian). This contrasts with Greek, which preserves the full grade instead (cf. grc@-μενος=-menos). Its past equivalent appears to be a conflation of the present participle and <i>*-tós</i>, also found in the transitive conjugations, as it appears to depart from a Pre-§lang_0 <i>**-omn̥tós</i>.</p>
<h4>Zeta variants</h4>
||TABLE-OR_DEF_SUF||
<p>As is the case for the transitive thematics, a small subgroup with suffixal stress exists, likewise named after the presence of <i>*-z-</i> in the future tense.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
||TABLE-OR_DEF_PFP||
<p>As briefly mentioned previously, Carite innovated a new stative for the old mediopassive. Concretely, this means attaching the primary suffixes to the weak grade of the stem, i.e. the <i>*(e)-(Ø)-</i> reduplication. As a result, in thematic intransitives, we find the suffixes associated with the zeta variant presents to indicate the past with a different stem. These new stative forms were then regularised, yielding many inconsistencies between Carite intransitive stative preterites and their cognates in other languages.</p>
<h3>Athematic</h3>
||TABLE-OR_RES_DEF||
<p>The suffixes of the athematic intransitive conjugation is rather straightforward. It appears to continue the suffix of the thematic paradigm, albeit without the thematic vowels. The future is identical and the subjunctive may have a slightly altered stem as in the transitive paradigms.</p>
<h2>Copula</h2>
||TABLE-COPULA||
<p>The copula is particularly archaic in its conjugation, not just displaying the original athematic endings on a root ending on a consonant, but also being the sole retainer of the original ablaut. Additionally, it is suppletive.</p>
<p>In the present indicative, we find the usual athematic endings attached to pie@h₁es- in the singular, with the second person reflecting <i>**-ssi</i> which was regularly degeminated through Proto-Indo-European phonotactics. In the plural forms, we find the zero grade which is curiously enough followed by a thematic vowel - this may explain why we find <i>*o</i> rather than <i>*e</i> in the third person plural. We find the same principles as outlined above in the subjunctive, where the singular receives a thematic vowel (and, as a result, thematic suffixes) while the plural forms receive another thematic vowel, which effectively lengthens it. The outcome is slightly different from the regular outcome due to the stressed vowel raising.</p>
<p>In the preterite, we find a continuation of pie@bʰuhₓ- instead (notably, without ablaut) which follows the expected athematic vocalic suffixes in both indicative and subjunctive.</p>
<p>In the future, we once again find reflexes of <i>*h₁es-</i>. In the singular, we find a stem identical to the present (presumably due to geminate </i>**-ss-</i> being simplified back in Proto-Indo-European) while in the plural, we curiously may reconstruct a stem departing from the present forms where, as in the subjunctive, the thematic vowel was reanalysed as being part of the stem. The imperative forms are more straightforward and line up better with what we have seen before.</p>
<p>For the participles, we find a variant of the Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-n̥tis</i> we find in other paradigms, being the original <i>*-onts</i> preceded by the zero grade of <i>*h₁es-</i>. It is likely this <i>*-o</i> - which was not a thematic vowel - was similarly reanalysed as belonging to the stem, at which point the usual athematic suffix could be added. The past participle consists of the preterite stem and the <i>*-tós</i> suffix.</p>
<h2>Gradation inheritance</h2>
<h3>Ablaut</h3>
<p>As previously inferred, stem gradation has disappeared throughout the paradigms (except the copula) with a single stem being globalised across the board. Even ablauting suffixes have been reduced to a single form.</p>
<h3>Reduplication</h3>
<p>Reduplication was not just unproductive in §lang_0, but also rare. A few verbs appear to continue an imperfect reduplication, such as °TETEMI° (< <i>*dʰédʰeh₁-</i>, from pie@deh₁-) and others. As for stem gradations, these stems were presumably also generalised across all tenses (although we have no actual attestations and this may be a later development).</p>
<h2>Eventive Stems</h2>
<h3>Root inflection</h3>
<p>The absolute majority of inherited verbs in §lang_0 consist of the relic category of root inflections; that is, a suffix (athematic or thematic; see above) directly attached to bare root.</p>
<h3>Statives</h3>
<p>In Proto-Indo-European, thematicised statives were formed using the ablauting suffix <i>*-eh₁- ~ *-h₁-</i>, which was in western Indo-European extended with a further thematic suffix <i>*-ye-</i>. In Carite, this class appears to be continued with the expected zero grade of the thematic suffix, i.e. <i>*-éh₁i-</i>, and almost exclusively shows a zero grade of the root, surfacing as °EHTI°. It is relatively rare.</p>
<h3>Nasal infixes</h3>
<p>Functionally nasal infixes formed transitive verbs from intransitive roots. It is worth noting that as in Latin, Carite nasal infixes had their zero grade generalised. As a result, all §lang_0 verbs that originated as nasal infixes belong to the zeta variant category.</p>
<h3>Nasal suffixes</h3>
<p>The original semantic area of the suffix <i>*-néwti</i> is not entirely clear, but it appears that in §lang_0, it has developed an inchoative meaning and surfaces as °NEWMI°.</p>
<h3>I-present</h3>
<p>Proto-Indo-European had two varieties of i-presents. The first showcased a zero grade of the root with tonic accent on the suffix and was always intransitive; many intransitive verbs continue this category. The second consisted of a stressed full grade of the root combined with transitive meaning; this category is not as present in Carite. In future stems, this palatal element <i>*-y-</i> was notably dropped. Both categories are relatively sparse in their Carite survival and function as relics.</p>
<h3>Causatives</h3>
<p>Particularly present, as in Germanic but lacking the productivity, are the causatives from <i>*-éyeti</i>, reformed into <i>*-éymi</i> per above, yieling °EYETI°. This suffix was attached to the o-grade of the stem.</p>
<h3>Denominatives</h3>
<p>The original denominative suffix, <i>*-eh₂yeti</i>, was likewise attached to the o-grade in its reformed form <i>*-éh₂imi</i> and yields °AHITI°. This form differs slightly from the expected result as we would expect <i>**-īmi</i> for the indicative - it is likely the a-vocalism was reborrowed from the subjunctive and future stems.</p>
<h3>Factitives</h3>
<p>A seemingly Carite-only innovation is the morphologisation of <i>*-oyeti</i> which, like the denominatives discussed above, appends the typical <i>*-yeti</i> to a nominal stem, although rather than the <i>*-eh₂-</i> of the denominatives, it is attached to the o-grade of o-stems. This suffix, reformed as <i>*-óymi</i>, was similarly attached to the o-grade of a stem and surfaces as °OYMI°.</p>
<h3>Iteratives & duratives</h3>
<p>The suffix <i>*-sḱ-</i> followed by an accentuated stressed vowel most likely had an iterative and/or durative function in Proto-Indo-European, which it continues in §lang_0. It was directly attached to the zero grade of the stem and yields °SKETI°. Due to the requirement of the zero grade, these formations always produced zeta variants.</p>
