<p>§lang_0's <b>reconstructed consonant inventory</b> as seen above can be considered relatively standard. The allophone status of [ŋ] was presumably already established back in Proto-Indo-European while it is likely that §lang_0 also featured a [ɱ] for its labiodental additions. [z] was originally an allophone in Proto-Indo-European, where it came into being through voicing assimilation, but received a phonemic status in early Carite thanks to Engels' law and Verner's Carite law (see below).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this inventory is reconstructed and the exact details are not entirely known. For example, a significant amount of caritologists believe that the labiodental fricatives were in fact regular labial in their execution, which would also make the reconstruction of an allophonic labiodental nasal redundant. They base their evidence on the labial nature of their origin (that is, the labiovelars they originated from) as well as scanty evidence that surrounding languages featured labial fricatives rather than labiodental ones. However, as this is not universally accepted, this documentation and lexicon restricted itself to the more mainstream analysis.</p>

<p>§lang_0's <b>reconstructed vowel inventory</b> mostly reflects the Late Proto-Indo-European vowel inventory with its typical five-vowel /a e i o u/ and short-long distinction; however, it features two noteworthy additions: the vowels /yː øː/ and an additional length distinction in /eːː oːː/. Some have suggested that §lang_0 did not actually possess overlong vowels and that they were more comparable to [ɛː ɔː]; this vision has been gaining traction but was deemed not mainstream enough to be adopted here.</p>
<h2>Suprasegmentals</h2>
<p>Stress fell on the first syllable of the stem - as such, prefixes such as the augment were never stressed.</p>
<h2>Morphophonology</h2>
<p>Besides an active regressive voicing assimilation filter (see below), we may find the collapse of two identical vowels into a single long vowel of the same quality, i.e. |V₁V₁(ː)| /V₁ː/. This is most apparent in the application of the augment (see below), where |e{e(ː)}| simply surfaces as /eː/.</p>
