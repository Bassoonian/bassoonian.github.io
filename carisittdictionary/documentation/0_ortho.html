<h1>Orthography</h1>
<p>§lang_0 is largely reconstructed in nature - only sporadic attestations exist. However, the attestations are numerous enough for us to be able to tentatively reconstruct the native alphabet that was used. Considering there were plenty of Ionic colonies nearby where the early Carites are presumed to have lived, it is unsurprising that §lang_0 employed its own variant of the Greek alphabet - one with many Ionic influences, that is.</p>
<h2>Consonants</h2>
<p>Nasals and plosives were written as in all Greek dialects - this means that /m n/ were notated as <<μ ν>> and /p b t d k ɡ/ were notated as <<π β τ δ κ γ>>. [ŋ], the prevelar allophone of /n/, was unsurprisingly written as <<γ>>.</p>
<p>With §lang_0 having a significantly larger (phonemic) fricative inventory than Ancient Greek, some unusualities are expected. The voiceless sibilant, /s/ was notated with <<σ>> or <<ς>> - as in Greek, the latter form was employed word-finally. Its voiced counterpart, /z/, appears to have been conveyed using <<ζ>>. While this may come across as rather surprising, it is worth noting that this specific graph stands out for two reasons. In several transcriptions, no orthographic voicing distinction appears to be made for the sibilants. In the majority of the cases, however, the distinction is made, and one could argue that <<ζ>> was in fact the closest approximation of /z/. While the notation of /f/ as <<φ>> may raise eyebrows at such early point in time, it is likely that the Dorians were starting to fricativise their aspirated stops by this point. While most of the contact of the early Carites with the Greeks involved an Ionic dialect, we can deduce from loans that contact with Dorian seafarers from the colonies on the Italian peninsula also occurred. This may have reinforced this orthographic tendency. Like /z/, /v/ was simply written as <<φ>> in some (presumably slightly earlier) inscriptions, while it is conveyed using the archaic letter <<ϝ>> in others. Worth noting is that both voiced fricatives were always written through as if they were voiceless when preceding a voiced obstruent.</p>
<p>The liquids /r l/ were expectedly written as <<ρ λ>> while the semivowels employed their syllabic equivalents, i.e. /j w/ were written as <<ι υ>>. While the usage of <<ψ>> for /h/ may seem blatantly erroneous at first, considering its representation of /ps/ in the eastern alphabets, western Greek did in fact employ this for /kʰ/ which makes this usage slightly more logical. It is worth noting that in several inscriptions, /h/ is not notated at all, which may be due to influence from the surrounding Ionic colonies on the mainland. In either case, it is logical breathing diacritics are not in use, considering they were not invented and employed until well after these inscriptions were made. The representation of /ks/ as <<χ>> lines up with the usage of <<ψ>> as this is the expected western usage of this glyph.</p>
<h2>Vowels</h2>
<p>The non-mid vowels /a(ː) i(ː) u(ː)/ did historically not distinguish length orthographically and were simply written as <<α ι υ>>. The short mid vowels appear to have been conveyed using their expected glyphs, being <<ε ο>> for /e o/, while their long equivalents, like in most of Greece, were represented using digraphs, i.e. <<ει ου>> for /eː oː/. Their overlong equivalents, /eːː oːː/, were relatively rare across the board, but did seemingly have their own glyphs, being <<η ω>>. /øː/ appears to have ben conveyed using the digraph <<ευ>> while /yː/ poses a more interesting aspect of the contact with multiple Greek dialects. It is likely Ionian already had /y(ː)/ for their <<υ>> while Laconian retained it as /u(ː)/ - in fact, they also happened to have different shapes. As mentioned earlier, Carite /u(ː)/ was written using Laconian <<υ>> - its high equivalent, /yː/, appears to have been conveyed with the Ionian <<y>>.</p>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>Please note that the alphabet as displayed above and employed in the lexicon is a modernised variant due to unicode limitations. By rendering the archaic letters with the modernised alphabet, including a distinction between upper- and lowercase, ease of use is greatly improved at the cost of historical accuracy. Many caritologists employ macrons in their modernisations to indicate length when not obvious from the orthography with a subset of those employing breves to mark semivowels due to their phonemic contrast with their syllabic equivalents - this may be turned off in the settings (top-right).</p>
<p>An alternative reconstructional notation using the Latin alphabet is frequently employed and even preferred by some caritologists. While it tends to simply represent the expected romanisations of the Greek orthography (including <<x>> for /ks/), it visually distinguishs the semivowels by employing <<j w>>. Additionally, the romanisation of [ŋ] differs between authors with some preferring <<g>>, analogically to many Greek romanisations, while most employ <<n>> in line with the nasal quality. /eː oː/, which are written as <<ει ου>> in the Greek orthography, are simply represented using a macron, i.e. <<ē ō>>, while their overlong equivalents employ a circumflex, i.e. <<ê ô>>, or, in some rare cases, a double macron. /øː/ is simply represented as <<ø̄>>.</p>
<p>It is only logical the inscriptions did not include diacritics - the typical diacritical marks associated with tone were only invented by roughly 200 BC, with the rough and smooth breathings only appearing for the first time slightly prior. As such, it is impossible to ascertain if §lang_0 still had mobile stress - however, even if stress would be notated, it is possible this would have been historical spelling and would not reflect the actual stress.</p>
