<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Antiquity</h2>
<p>The early history of the Carite people is not the most clear. We may find several attestations that can be dated to roughly 500 BC around Narbonne, France - enough for us to reconstruct the general tendencies of an alphabet, but not much more.</p>
<h2>Carite Dark Ages</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, from the 4th century BC onwards, there is a significant gap in attestations. We may find Tacitus reference a group of people - the <i>*Caristii</i> - living in the Iberian Peninsula; however, there is no description of the language they speak, only a single mythological sample featuring the Latinisation of a deity.</p>
