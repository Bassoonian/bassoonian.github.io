<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Situating the origin of §lang_0 is a difficult task. The earliest independent Carite layer is generally dated to 500 BC near Narbonne, France. Given the presence of some PIE roots and formations that are considered to be exclusive to eastern branches, it seems likely the speakers had contact with early instances of Greek and Armenian before migrating further westwards with speakers of what would later become the Celtic language family. Dating the layers of the language's periods of intensive contact with its sister-languages and, later, non-Indo-European peoples is difficult, as much of its early history is obscured by the relative paucity and late attestation of records, but methods of internal reconstruction and comparison of shared innovations help shed some light on Carite's prehistory.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, comparisons will be made with Proto-Celtic, Ancient Greek, Latin and Proto-Germanic, as these were the branches that are not only the closest geographically, but also appear to share numerous developments. While not overly relevant, comparisons with Armenian will be made due to its genetic affinity.</p>
<p>Due to the scope of this chapter, it is only logical that the development from Proto-Indo-European to §lang_0 involves the most prose and is highly technical. If you are interested in the history of Carite but perceive this chapter as too dense, you may find the other developmental chapters easier to understand.</p>
<h2>Orthography</h2>
<p>§lang_0 is largely reconstructed in nature - only sporadic attestations exist. However, the attestations are numerous enough for us to be able to tentatively reconstruct the native alphabet that was used. Considering there were plenty of Ionic colonies nearby where the early Carites are presumed to have lived, it is unsurprising that §lang_0 employed its own variant of the Greek alphabet - one with many Ionic influences, that is.</p>
<p>Nasals and plosives were written as in all Greek dialects - this means that /m n/ were notated as <<μ ν>> and /p b t d k ɡ/ were notated as <<π β τ δ κ γ>>. [ŋ], the prevelar allophone of /n/, was unsurprisingly written as <<γ>>.</p>
<p>With §lang_0 having a significantly larger (phonemic) fricative inventory than Ancient Greek, some unusualities are expected. The voiceless sibilant, /s/ was notated with <<σ>> or <<ς>> - as in Greek, the latter form was employed word-finally. Its voiced counterpart, /z/, appears to have been conveyed using <<ζ>>. While this may come across as rather surprising, it is worth noting that this specific graph stands out for two reasons. In several transcriptions, no orthographic voicing distinction appears to be made for the sibilants. In the majority of the cases, however, the distinction is made, and one could argue that <<ζ>> was in fact the closest approximation of /z/. While the notation of /f/ as <<φ>> may raise eyebrows at such early point in time, it is likely that the Dorians were starting to fricativise their aspirated stops by this point. While most of the contact of the early Carites with the Greeks involved an Ionic dialect, we can deduce from loans that contact with Dorian seafarers from the colonies on the Italian peninsula also occurred. This may have reinforced this orthographic tendency. Like /z/, /v/ was simply written as <<φ>> in some (presumably slightly earlier) inscriptions, while it is conveyed using the archaic letter <<ϝ>> in others.</p>
<p>The liquids /r l/ were expectedly written as <<ρ λ>> while the semivowels employed their syllabic equivalents, i.e. /j w/ were written as <<ι υ>>. While the usage of <<ψ>> for /h/ may seem blatantly erroneous at first, considering its representation of /ps/ in the eastern alphabets, western Greek did in fact employ this for /kʰ/ which makes this usage slightly more logical. It is worth noting that in several inscriptions, /h/ is not notated at all, which may be due to influence from the surrounding Ionic colonies on the mainland. In either case, it is logical breathing diacritics are not in use, considering they were not invented and employed until well after these inscriptions were made. The representation of /ks/ as <<χ>> lines up with the usage of <<ψ>> as this is the expected western usage of this glyph.</p>
<p>The non-mid vowels /a(ː) i(ː) u(ː)/ did historically not distinguish length orthographically and were simply written as <<α ι υ>>. The short mid vowels appear to have been conveyed using their expected glyphs, being <<ε ο>> for /e o/, while their long equivalents, like in most of Greece, were represented using digraphs, i.e. <<ει ου>> for /eː oː/. Their overlong equivalents, /eːː oːː/, were relatively rare across the board, but did seemingly have their own glyphs, being <<η ω>>. /øː/ appears to have ben conveyed using the digraph <<ευ>> while /yː/ poses a more interesting aspect of the contact with multiple Greek dialects. It is likely Ionian already had /y(ː)/ for their <<υ>> while Laconian retained it as /u(ː)/ - in fact, they also happened to have different shapes. As mentioned earlier, Carite /u(ː)/ was written using Laconian <<υ>> - its high equivalent, /yː/, appears to have been conveyed with the Ionian <<y>>.</p>
<p>Please note that the alphabet as displayed above and employed in the lexicon is a modernised variant due to unicode limitations. By rendering the archaic letters with the modernised alphabet, including a distinction between upper- and lowercase, ease of use is greatly improved at the cost of historical accuracy. Many linguists employ macrons in their modernisations to indicate length when not obvious from the orthography - this may be turned off in the settings (top-right).</p>
<p>An alternative reconstructional notation using the Latin alphabet is frequently employed and even preferred by some caritologists. While it tends to simply represent the expected romanisations of the Greek orthography (including <<x>> for /ks/), it visually distinguishs the semivowels by employing <<j w>>. Additionally, the romanisation of [ŋ] differs between authors with some preferring <<g>>, analogically to many Greek romanisations, while most employ <<n>> in line with the nasal quality. /eː oː/, which are written as <<ει ου>> in the Greek orthography, are simply represented using a macron, i.e. <<ē ō>>, while their overlong equivalents employ a circumflex, i.e. <<ê ô>>, or, in some rare cases, a double macron. /øː/ is simply represented as <<ø̄>>.</p>
<p>It is only logical the inscriptions did not include diacritics - the typical diacritical marks associated with tone were only invented by roughly 200 BC, with the rough and smooth breathings only appearing for the first time slightly prior. As such, it is impossible to ascertain if §lang_0 still had mobile stress - however, even if stress would be notated, it is possible this would have been historical spelling and would not reflect the actual stress.</p>
<h2>Regular Sound Changes</h2>
<p>Several of Carite historical processes are firmly dateable to the Common Indo-European period. Thus, their internal history is generally impossible to investigate further.</p>
||SOUNDCHANGES||
<h2>Nominal Morphology</h2>
<p>Much of early Carite nominal morphology closely followed the typical western Indo-European model. The declension of nouns and adjectives was closely linked together, and they shared most of their morphology. Degrees of comparison in adjectives have been morphologised for some time, but this comparative system also partook in the normal nominal inflection processes.</p>
<p>Carite nouns distinguished eight cases, the full western Indo-European set, as in Proto-Celtic, but reflected only two numbers, having lost the morphological dual and replacing it thoroughly with the inherited plural. Carite reflected all three genders cleanly at this point, and amplified the distinction between feminines and masculines through inter-paradigmatic analogy. All adjectives tended to reflect all three genders through change of suffix inflection class; the analogical component of gender agreement was much stronger in early Carite than in the roughly contemporaneous Old Latin or Ancient Greek, which still had adjectives that conflated some of the gender categories.</p>
<p>The declensional classes of Indo-European underwent a thorough remodelling, with widespread vocalisation of previous consonantal stems. There were five major classes of noun stems: o-stems, a-stems, i-stems, inherited neuter acrostatic os-stems and nasal stems. Old u-stems and consonant-stems were either remodelled into alternative athematic classes (typically remade as i-stems), or fully thematised into an a-stem or o-stem.</p>
<p>In inflection, Carite nouns also reflect the Indo-European accent system to some extent: nearly all declensional classes (that is, apart from acrostatics) have accent-sensitive declension, with alternative endings for nouns with an etymological oxytonic accent pattern. It's uncertain whether the accent really was still in such a position in early Carite, as the inscriptions are unmarked for stress, but it was certainly on its way out at that point.</p>
<h3>Thematic Nominals</h3>
<p>This category of nominals includes o-stems and a-stems and is widely referred to as the thematic set due to the naming conventions of the equivalents of these declension categories in Proto-Indo-European. Many of the archaic r/n-stem nouns were converted into neuter thematics; however, exceptions are plenty. Words ending on <i>*-ōs</i> were thematicised into <i>**-osos</i> or <i>**-oseh₂</i>, depending on the gender of the noun. The <i>*-ēr</i> nouns, mostly restricted to familial terminology, were also thematicised into <i>**-ros</i> or <i>**-reh₂.</i></p>
<h4>O-stems</h4>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The <b>radical masculine thematic</b> table on the right provides a good starting point for the o-stems. Most of its forms very cleanly continue the Indo-European masculine o-stem inflection: the top three singular forms continue the universally accepted suffixes <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="hovertext" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ος (-os), Latin -us, Proto-Germanic *-az, Armenian -∅"><i>*-os</i></span>, <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="hovertext" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ε (-e), Latin -e, Proto-Germanic *-∅"><i>*-e</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ον (-on), Latin -um, Proto-Germanic *-ą"><i>*-om</i></span>. The genitive singular appears to continue <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ου (-ou, <Proto-Greek *-oyyo), Old Latin -osio, Armenian -ոյ (-oy)"><i>*-osyo</i></span>, which is the pronominal equivalent of the <i>*-os</i> §oxf_intro reconstructs; the <i>-ī</i> that appears in Italo-Celtic is of unknown origin. The long vowels in the ablative and dative singular were presumably already present in Proto-Indo-European <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ō (< Old Latin -ōd)"><i>*-ōd</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ω(ι) (-ō(i)), Latin -ō, Proto-Germanic *-ai"><i>*-ōy</i></span> (where the long vowel is the result of an original <i>**o-e</i> contraction according to §oxf_intro and §compgrammar) - §ed_germanic's ablative suffix, <i>*-ead</i>, is incompatible with the Carite reflex; §compgrammar posits <i>*-ōt</i> instead but remarks that Sabellic has <i>*-ōd</i>, supposedly from <i>**-oVt</i>. Additionally, he mentions that the original late form may have been <i>*-ā-</i>, with the substitution with <i>*-ō-</i> being a late analogical development shared with Latin. The locative and instrumental cases also faithfully reflect the Indo-European suffixes <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ī, Armenian -∅"><i>*-oy</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ō"><i>*-oh₁</i></span>, respectively. As pointed out by §compgrammar, <i>*o</i> as thematic vowel for the locative contrasts with the <i>*e</i> found in consonant stems and must be a late development.</p>
			<p>The plural nominative form does not appear to continue the typical <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Irish -u, maybe Armenian -ք (-kʿ)"><i>*-ōs</i></span><!--Ringe's overlong vowel???--> (again, from an original <i>**-oes</i>) but continues the pronominal suffix <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Irish -∅, Ancient Greek -οι (-oi), Latin -ī (< Old Latin -oe)"><i>*-oy</i></span> of the same usage - this conflation took place in all branches except for Indo-Iranian and Germanic. It is worth noting that, like Old Irish, Carite retained the non-pronominal ending in the vocative plural. The accusative once again faithfully reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ονς (-ons), Latin -ōs, Proto-Germanic *-anz, Armenian -ս (-s)"><i>*-ons</i></span>. While the long vowel of the genitive plural suffix is incompatible with §oxf_intro's <i>*-om</i> (and positing <i>**-o-em</i> would be baseless here), it the expected reflex of both <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ων (-ōn), Latin -[ōr]um"><i>*-ōm</i></span> as posited by §compgrammar and of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ǫ̂"><i>*-(o)ohₓom</i></span> as posited by §ed_germanic. §oxf_intro's reconstructions for the remaining forms, being <i>*-om</i>, <i>*-oybʰ(y)os ~ *-omus</i>, <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -οισι (-oisi)"><i>*-oysu</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -οις (-ois), Latin -īs (< Old Latin -eis)"><i>-*ōys</i></span> must be discarded in a Carite context - the same goes for §ed_germanic's <i>*-o(y)mos</i> for dative and ablative and its locative and instrumental suffixes, which are identical to §oxf_intro's. The dative and ablative plural forms appear to continue <i>*-obʰos</i>. This apparent interchange between <i>*-bʰ-</i> and <i>*-m-</i> is without a doubt Post-Proto-Indo-European.</p>
			<p>The <b>oxytonic masculine thematic</b> table, as expected, mostly mirrors its radical equivalent - the only discrepancies are caused by the stressed raising of Pre-§lang_0 <i>*ō</i>. More precisely, the deviating forms are the ablative, dative and instrumental singular as well as the vocative, genitive and instrumental plural forms.</p>

			<p>Most of what needs to be said about the <b>neuter thematic</b> tables - providing a neuter version of the o-stems - has been discussed above; after all, the oblique forms are identical, and we can see that the other three cases all share a suffix. In the singular, this is the same form as the accusative case as discussed above. In the plural, we find the reflex of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -α (-a), Latin -a, Proto-Germanic *-ō"><i>*-eh₂</i></span>, which historically presumably formed the departure point of the a-stems.</p>

			<p>The <b>radical feminine thematic</b> table on the left clearly shows that the vowel distribution was significantly simpler in a-stems than in o-stems. The nominative singular form has been discussed above as it is identical to the non-oblique neuter plural forms. Despite also departing from the same <i>*-eh₂</i>, the reflex of the vocative suffix is short rather than the expected long vowel. It appears that in the vocative suffix, the laryngeal was dropped after colouring but before the lengthening - alternatively, one may posit that word-final <i>*-VH</i> only underwent lengthening if the following word started with a consonant (as almost all do), and that the vocative nature separated it from the rest of the clause, thus preventing the lengthening from occurring. It is more than likely that this also happened in the other branches; however, in many cases, the vocative suffix was later made identical to the nominative suffix, undoing this distinction in length. It is not sure if §lang_0 also began this process of analogy - the metre of a specific inscription does in fact point towards a short vowel, however. The accusative in Carite may go back to both <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ην (-ēn), Latin -am, Proto-Germanic -ǭ"><i>*-eh₂m</i></span> or another form with the more regular syllabicisation <i>*-eh₂m̥</i> - the Greek forms require the former, however. The genitive cleanly reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ης (-ēs), arch. Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic -ōz"><i>*-eh₂(e)s</i></span> while the ablative with its word-final dental must reflect a pre-§lang_0 <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ā (< Old Latin -ād)"><i>*-eh₂d</i></span>. The dative regularly continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ηι (-ēi), Latin -ae"><i>*-eh₂ey</i></span> <!--Germanic -ôi???-->while the locative equally regularly reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -αι (-ai), Latin -ae (with secondary lengthening)"><i>*-eh₂i</i></span>. <!--Instrumental--></p>
			<p>Unlike the o-stems, a-stems retained their non-pronominal suffix in the nominative plural, continuing <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Latin -ās"><i>*-eh₂(e)s</i></span><!--Ringe's overlong vowel???-->. Like in the singular, the accusative plural is inconclusive about a possible syllabicisation of the nasal in <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ας (-ās), Latin -ās"><i>*-eh₂ms</i></span><!-- Germanic -ōz?-->. The genitive plural appears to be identical to the o-stems. It is likely that it contained <i>*-eh₂-</i> plus whichever form the o-stems are derived from and the resulting sequences <i>**aōm</i> contracted. Similar constructions are attest in the other languages; Ancient Greek and Latin, however, had pronominal contamination. Like in the o-stems, the remaining plural suffixes are harder to find clear cognates for.</p>

	</div>
</div>
<h4>Adjectives</h4>
<p>Thematic adjectives were likewise either radical or oxytonic and employed o-stem inflections for the masculine and neuter declensions and a-stem inflections for the feminine declensions. The actual suffixes appear to have been identical, as can be seen below:</p>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_UNSTRESSED_DEF||</br>||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_DEF||
<h3>Iotic Nominals</h3>
<p>The iotic category is made up of i-stem nouns and adjectives. As mentioned above, many other declension types were analogised as i-stems, often but not always in a predictable matter. U-stem adjectives were reformed as oxytonic i-stem adjectives based on their hysterokinetic patterns; an example is pie@délkus, which had a hysterokinetic variant <i>*dl̥kús</i>, being reformed into <i>**dl̥kwís</i> resulting in early Carite dilvis. I-stem adjectives as well as proterokinetic athematic nominals - both i-stems and u-stems - generalised the nominative stem.</p>
<p>Consonant stem nouns generally turned into i-stem nouns; however, the inclusion of the original word-final <i>*-s</i> is not entirely consistent. For example, pie@h₃ókʷs was reformed as <i>**h₃ókʷsi</i> resulting in early Carite osmi while pie@h₂énh₂ts resulted into anatī which lacks the original nominative suffix. In nouns where the hypercorrect application of Szemerényi's law resulted into nominatives with a long root vowel, the vowel was analogised back to its original state; an example is pie@dṓm, which had <i>*dóm</i> and <i>*déms</i> as its vocative and genitive, respectively, surfacing as early Carite domī.</p>
<p>All words ending on <i>*-tōr</i> were also analogised into <i>*-tris</i>, most likely through analogy with its feminine equivalent <i>*-trih₂</i>.</p>
<h3>Nasal Nominals</h3>
<p>The nasal category is made up of the nouns that end on <i>*-mō</i> and <i>*-mn̥</i>. These nouns are either or masculine; no feminine derivation is attested. Several of the neuter collective forms were reanalysed into masculine nouns before the collective perished and gave way to plural forms that came into being through analogy. Worth noting is the consonant in the ablative, dative and locative plurals, reflecting the deaspiration of <i>*bʰ</i> following nasals, contrasting with the surfacing p in other declensions.</p>
<h3>Acrostatic Nominals</h3>
<p>The class of acrostatic nominals is a rather closed class and only contains a select handful of neuter nouns.</p>
<h2>Numerals</h2>
<p>As in Proto-Indo-European, the numerals for one, two and three are inflected for gender and case while the numeral for four has generalised the nominative neuter form and become uninflected like the numbers the follow it.</p>
<p>The inflection of ø̄nos follows the standard radical inflection pattern of the thematic nominals with the obvious exception that plural forms do not exist.</p>
<p>The archaic dual number, which was phased out everywhere else in Carite, has kept its trace in the inflection of dwū, which is synchronically analysed as an irregular inflection.</p>
<p>The last of the inflecting numerals, três, faithfully follows the oxytonic plural inflection of the iotic nominals.</p>
<h2>Pronouns</h2>
<p>Carite pronouns are somewhat innovative when viewed in a European context: it shares with the Celtic language family a levelling of the pronominal nominative according to the oblique stem across all personal pronouns for the first and second persons.</p>
<p>The third person pronouns are related to pclt@es and lat@is. Of note, however, is that they continue the levelling of the nominative according to the accusative like the preceding pronouns did. However, their oblique stems remain separate.</p>
<h2>Verbal Morphology</h2>
