<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Situating the origin of §lang_0 is a difficult task. The earliest independent Carite layer is generally dated to 500 BC near Narbonne, France. Given the presence of some PIE roots and formations that are considered to be exclusive to eastern branches, it seems likely the speakers had contact with early instances of Greek and Armenian before migrating further westwards with speakers of what would later become the Celtic language family. Dating the layers of the language's periods of intensive contact with its sister-languages and, later, non-Indo-European peoples is difficult, as much of its early history is obscured by the relative paucity and late attestation of records, but methods of internal reconstruction and comparison of shared innovations help shed some light on Carite's prehistory.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, comparisons will be made with Proto-Celtic, Ancient Greek, Latin and Proto-Germanic, as these were the branches that are not only the closest geographically, but also appear to share numerous developments. While not overly relevant, comparisons with Armenian will be made due to its genetic affinity.</p>
<p>Due to the scope of this chapter, it is only logical that the development from Proto-Indo-European to §lang_0 involves the most prose and is highly technical. If you are interested in the history of Carite but perceive this chapter as too dense, you may find the other developmental chapters easier to understand.</p>
<h2>Orthography</h2>||SOURCE?||
<p>§lang_0 is largely reconstructed in nature - only sporadic attestations exist. However, the attestations are numerous enough for us to be able to tentatively reconstruct the native alphabet that was used. Considering there were plenty of Ionic colonies nearby where the early Carites are presumed to have lived, it is unsurprising that §lang_0 employed its own variant of the Greek alphabet - one with many Ionic influences, that is.</p>
<p>Nasals and plosives were written as in all Greek dialects - this means that /m n/ were notated as <<μ ν>> and /p b t d k ɡ/ were notated as <<π β τ δ κ γ>>. [ŋ], the prevelar allophone of /n/, was unsurprisingly written as <<γ>>.</p>
<p>With §lang_0 having a significantly larger (phonemic) fricative inventory than Ancient Greek, some unusualities are expected. The voiceless sibilant, /s/ was notated with <<σ>> or <<ς>> - as in Greek, the latter form was employed word-finally. Its voiced counterpart, /z/, appears to have been conveyed using <<ζ>>. While this may come across as rather surprising, it is worth noting that this specific graph stands out for two reasons. In several transcriptions, no orthographic voicing distinction appears to be made for the sibilants. In the majority of the cases, however, the distinction is made, and one could argue that <<ζ>> was in fact the closest approximation of /z/. While the notation of /f/ as <<φ>> may raise eyebrows at such early point in time, it is likely that the Dorians were starting to fricativise their aspirated stops by this point. While most of the contact of the early Carites with the Greeks involved an Ionic dialect, we can deduce from loans that contact with Dorian seafarers from the colonies on the Italian peninsula also occurred. This may have reinforced this orthographic tendency. Like /z/, /v/ was simply written as <<φ>> in some (presumably slightly earlier) inscriptions, while it is conveyed using the archaic letter <<ϝ>> in others.</p>
<p>The liquids /r l/ were expectedly written as <<ρ λ>> while the semivowels employed their syllabic equivalents, i.e. /j w/ were written as <<ι υ>>. While the usage of <<ψ>> for /h/ may seem blatantly erroneous at first, considering its representation of /ps/ in the eastern alphabets, western Greek did in fact employ this for /kʰ/ which makes this usage slightly more logical. It is worth noting that in several inscriptions, /h/ is not notated at all, which may be due to influence from the surrounding Ionic colonies on the mainland. In either case, it is logical breathing diacritics are not in use, considering they were not invented and employed until well after these inscriptions were made. The representation of /ks/ as <<χ>> lines up with the usage of <<ψ>> as this is the expected western usage of this glyph.</p>
<p>The non-mid vowels /a(ː) i(ː) u(ː)/ did historically not distinguish length orthographically and were simply written as <<α ι υ>>. The short mid vowels appear to have been conveyed using their expected glyphs, being <<ε ο>> for /e o/, while their long equivalents, like in most of Greece, were represented using digraphs, i.e. <<ει ου>> for /eː oː/. Their overlong equivalents, /eːː oːː/, were relatively rare across the board, but did seemingly have their own glyphs, being <<η ω>>. /øː/ appears to have ben conveyed using the digraph <<ευ>> while /yː/ poses a more interesting aspect of the contact with multiple Greek dialects. It is likely Ionian already had /y(ː)/ for their <<υ>> while Laconian retained it as /u(ː)/ - in fact, they also happened to have different shapes. As mentioned earlier, Carite /u(ː)/ was written using Laconian <<υ>> - its high equivalent, /yː/, appears to have been conveyed with the Ionian <<y>>.</p>
<p>Please note that the alphabet as displayed above and employed in the lexicon is a modernised variant due to unicode limitations. By rendering the archaic letters with the modernised alphabet, including a distinction between upper- and lowercase, ease of use is greatly improved at the cost of historical accuracy. Many caritologists employ macrons in their modernisations to indicate length when not obvious from the orthography with a subset of those employing breves to mark semivowels due to their phonemic contrast with their syllabic equivalents - this may be turned off in the settings (top-right).</p>
<p>An alternative reconstructional notation using the Latin alphabet is frequently employed and even preferred by some caritologists. While it tends to simply represent the expected romanisations of the Greek orthography (including <<x>> for /ks/), it visually distinguishs the semivowels by employing <<j w>>. Additionally, the romanisation of [ŋ] differs between authors with some preferring <<g>>, analogically to many Greek romanisations, while most employ <<n>> in line with the nasal quality. /eː oː/, which are written as <<ει ου>> in the Greek orthography, are simply represented using a macron, i.e. <<ē ō>>, while their overlong equivalents employ a circumflex, i.e. <<ê ô>>, or, in some rare cases, a double macron. /øː/ is simply represented as <<ø̄>>.</p>
<p>It is only logical the inscriptions did not include diacritics - the typical diacritical marks associated with tone were only invented by roughly 200 BC, with the rough and smooth breathings only appearing for the first time slightly prior. As such, it is impossible to ascertain if §lang_0 still had mobile stress - however, even if stress would be notated, it is possible this would have been historical spelling and would not reflect the actual stress.</p>
<h2>Regular Sound Changes</h2>
<p>Several of Carite historical processes are firmly dateable to the Common Indo-European period. Thus, their internal history is generally impossible to investigate further.</p>
||SOUNDCHANGES||
<h2>Nominal Morphology</h2>||SOURCE?||
<p>Much of early Carite nominal morphology closely followed the typical western Indo-European model. The declension of nouns and adjectives was closely linked together, and they shared most of their morphology. Degrees of comparison in adjectives have been morphologised for some time, but this comparative system also partook in the normal nominal inflection processes.</p>
<p>Carite nouns distinguished eight cases, the full western Indo-European set, as in Proto-Celtic, but reflected only two numbers, having lost the morphological dual and replacing it thoroughly with the inherited plural. Carite reflected all three genders cleanly at this point, and amplified the distinction between feminines and masculines through inter-paradigmatic analogy. All adjectives tended to reflect all three genders through change of suffix inflection class; the analogical component of gender agreement was much stronger in early Carite than in the roughly contemporaneous Old Latin or Ancient Greek, which still had adjectives that conflated some of the gender categories.</p>
<p>The declensional classes of Indo-European underwent a thorough remodelling, with widespread vocalisation of previous consonantal stems. There were five major classes of noun stems: o-stems, a-stems, i-stems, inherited neuter acrostatic os-stems and nasal stems. Old u-stems and consonant-stems were either remodelled into alternative athematic classes (typically remade as i-stems, see below), or fully thematised into an a-stem or o-stem.</p>
<p>In inflection, Carite nouns also reflect the Indo-European accent system to some extent: nearly all declensional classes (that is, apart from acrostatics) have accent-sensitive declension, with alternative endings for nouns with an etymological oxytonic accent pattern. It's uncertain whether the accent really was still in such a position in early Carite, as the inscriptions are unmarked for stress, but it was certainly on its way out at that point.</p>
<h3>Thematic Nominals</h3>
<p>This category of nominals includes o-stems and a-stems and is widely referred to as the thematic set due to the naming conventions of the equivalents of these declension categories in Proto-Indo-European. Some caritologists refer to them as the second and first declension, respectively, after the names in Ancient Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>Many of the archaic r/n-stem nouns were converted into neuter thematics; however, exceptions are plenty. Words ending on <i>*-ōs</i> were thematicised into <i>**-osos</i> or <i>**-oseh₂</i>, depending on the gender of the noun. The <i>*-ēr</i> nouns, mostly restricted to familial terminology, were also thematicised into <i>**-ros</i> or <i>**-reh₂.</i></p>
<h4>O-stems</h4>||SOURCE0||
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The <b>radical masculine thematic</b> table on the right provides a good starting point for the o-stems. Most of its forms very cleanly continue the Indo-European masculine o-stem inflection: the top three singular forms continue the universally accepted suffixes <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="hovertext" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ος (-os), Latin -us, Proto-Germanic *-az, Armenian -∅"><i>*-os</i></span>, <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="hovertext" title="cf.

Ancient Greek -ον (-on), Latin -um, Proto-Germanic *-ą"><i>*-om</i></span>. The genitive singular appears to continue <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ου (-ou, <Proto-Greek *-oyyo), Old Latin -osio, Armenian -ոյ (-oy)"><i>*-osyo</i></span>, which is the pronominal equivalent of the <i>*-os</i> §oxf_intro reconstructs; the <i>-ī</i> that appears in Italo-Celtic is of unknown origin. The long vowels in the ablative and dative singular were presumably already present in Proto-Indo-European <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ō (< Old Latin -ōd)"><i>*-ōd</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ω(ι) (-ō(i)), Latin -ō, Proto-Germanic *-ai"><i>*-ōy</i></span> (where the long vowel is the result of an original <i>**o-e</i> contraction according to §oxf_intro and §compgrammar) - §ed_germanic's ablative suffix, <i>*-ead</i>, is incompatible with the Carite reflex; §compgrammar posits <i>*-ōt</i> instead but remarks that Sabellic has <i>*-ōd</i>, supposedly from <i>**-oVt</i>. Additionally, he mentions that the original late form may have been <i>*-ā-</i>, with the substitution with <i>*-ō-</i> being a late analogical development shared with Latin. The locative and instrumental cases also faithfully reflect the Indo-European suffixes <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ī, Armenian -∅"><i>*-oy</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ō"><i>*-oh₁</i></span>, respectively. As pointed out by §compgrammar, <i>*o</i> as thematic vowel for the locative contrasts with the <i>*e</i> found in consonant stems and must be a late development.</p>
			<p>The plural nominative form does not appear to continue the typical <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Irish -u, Proto-Germanic *-ôz, maybe Armenian -ք (-kʿ)"><i>*-ōs</i></span> (again, from an original <i>**-oes</i>) but continues the pronominal suffix <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Irish -∅, Ancient Greek -οι (-oi), Latin -ī (< Old Latin -oe)"><i>*-oy</i></span> of the same usage - this conflation took place in all branches except for Indo-Iranian and Germanic. It is worth noting that, like Old Irish, Carite retained the non-pronominal ending in the vocative plural. The accusative once again faithfully reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ονς (-ons), Latin -ōs, Proto-Germanic *-anz, Armenian -ս (-s)"><i>*-ons</i></span>. While the long vowel of the genitive plural suffix is incompatible with §oxf_intro's <i>*-om</i> (and positing <i>**-o-em</i> would be baseless here), it the expected reflex of both <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ων (-ōn), Latin -[ōr]um"><i>*-ōm</i></span> as posited by §compgrammar and of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ǫ̂"><i>*-(o)ohₓom</i></span> as posited by §ed_germanic. §oxf_intro's reconstructions for the remaining forms, being <i>*-om</i>, <i>*-oybʰ(y)os ~ *-omus</i>, <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -οισι (-oisi)"><i>*-oysu</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -οις (-ois), Latin -īs (< Old Latin -eis)"><i>-*ōys</i></span> must be discarded in a Carite context - the same goes for §ed_germanic's <i>*-o(y)mos</i> for dative and ablative and its locative and instrumental suffixes, which are identical to §oxf_intro's. For further discussion, please refer to the relevant chapter.</p>
			<p>The <b>oxytonic masculine thematic</b> table, as expected, mostly mirrors its radical equivalent - the only discrepancies are caused by the stressed raising of Pre-§lang_0 <i>*ō</i>. More precisely, the deviating forms are the ablative, dative and instrumental singular as well as the vocative, genitive and instrumental plural forms.</p>

			<p>Most of what needs to be said about the <b>neuter thematic</b> tables - providing a neuter version of the o-stems - has been discussed above; after all, the oblique forms are identical, and we can see that the other three cases all share a suffix. In the singular, this is the same form as the accusative case as discussed above. In the plural, we find the reflex of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf.

			<p>The <b>radical feminine thematic</b> table on the left clearly shows that the vowel distribution was significantly simpler in a-stems than in o-stems. The nominative singular form has been discussed above as it is identical to the non-oblique neuter plural forms. Despite also departing from the same <i>*-eh₂</i>, the reflex of the vocative suffix is short rather than the expected long vowel. It appears that in the vocative suffix, the laryngeal was dropped after colouring but before the lengthening - alternatively, one may posit that word-final <i>*-VH</i> only underwent lengthening if the following word started with a consonant (as almost all do), and that the vocative nature separated it from the rest of the clause, thus preventing the lengthening from occurring. It is more than likely that this also happened in the other branches; however, in many cases, the vocative suffix was later made identical to the nominative suffix, undoing this distinction in length. It is not sure if §lang_0 also began this process of analogy - the metre of a specific inscription does in fact point towards a short vowel, however. The accusative in Carite may go back to both <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ην (-ēn), Latin -am, Proto-Germanic -ǭ"><i>*-eh₂m</i></span> or another form with the more regular syllabicisation <i>*-eh₂m̥</i> - the Greek forms require the former, however. This issue appears to be important enough for a reconstruction <i>*-ām</i> to exist (cf. §pie_to_pgmc). The genitive cleanly reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ης (-ēs), arch. Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic -ōz"><i>*-eh₂(e)s</i></span> while the ablative with its word-final dental must reflect a pre-§lang_0 <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ā (< Old Latin -ād)"><i>*-eh₂d</i></span> rather than <i>*-eh₂s</i> - this is clearly a transfer from the o-stems. The dative regularly continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ηι (-ēi), Latin -ae, Proto-Germanic *-ôi"><i>*-eh₂ey</i></span> while the locative equally regularly reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -αι (-ai), Latin -ae (with secondary lengthening)"><i>*-eh₂i</i></span>. The instrumental must continue <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ō"><i>*-eh₂h₁</i></span> as the reflex of <i>*-eh₂eh₁</i> would be bisyllabic.</p>
			<p>Unlike the o-stems, a-stems retained their non-pronominal suffix in the nominative plural, continuing <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic -ôz"><i>*-eh₂es</i></span>. Like in the singular, the accusative plural is inconclusive about a possible syllabicisation of the nasal in <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ας (-ās), Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic *-ōz"><i>*-eh₂ms</i></span> - as in the singular, some reconstruct <i>*-āns</i> instead. The genitive plural appears to be identical to the o-stems. It is likely that it contained <i>*-eh₂-</i> plus whichever form the o-stems are derived from and the resulting sequence <i>**aōm</i> contracted, possibly through analogy with the o-stems. Similar constructions are attest in the other languages; Ancient Greek and Latin, however, had pronominal contamination. Like in the o-stems, the remaining plural suffixes are harder to find clear cognates for, although the instrumental plural suffix <i>*-eh₂bʰi</i> posited by §oxf_intro and §pie_to_pgmc seems relevant. As above, please refer to the relevant chapter below for further discussion.</p>
			<p>Similar to the o-stems, the <b>oxytonic feminine thematic</b> table on the left is near identical to its radical equivalent. The deviating forms are locative singular, which underwent the raising of long, stressed mid vowels, and the genitive plural, which helps us posit two theories about its origin: either the entire suffix was transferred from the o-stems after the the raising of long stressed mid vowels, or the <i>*-á-</i> that presumably preceded it earlier had already undergone contraction with the adjacent long vowel before the raising occurred.</p>

	</div>
</div>
<h4>Adjectives</h4>
<p>Thematic adjectives were likewise either radical or oxytonic and employed o-stem inflections for the masculine and neuter declensions and a-stem inflections for the feminine declensions. The actual suffixes appear to have been identical, as can be seen below:</p>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_UNSTRESSED_DEF||</br>||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_DEF||
<h3>Iotic Nominals</h3>||SOURCE?||
<p>The iotic category is made up of i-stem nouns and adjectives. Two things are noteworthy about the iotic nominals in Carite: the proliferation of the <i>*-ih₂</i> paradigm as functional feminine and the almost wholesale absorption of the u-stems and consonant stems. It is very likely these two processes not just happened at the roughly same time, but also reinforced each other: the Proto-Indo-European <i>*-ih₂ ~ *-yeh₂-</i> inflection - referred to as the <i>devī</i> inflection by §compgrammar - was a relatively productive class, forming feminine derivatives of (among others) the athematic stems. For example, for the present participle <i>*-ont-s</i>, we find a feminine in <i>*-ont-ih₂</i> and for u-stem adjectives on <i>*-u-s</i>, we find <i>*(e)w-ih₂</i>. The combination of <i>*-is</i> being identical for both masculine and feminine uses in Proto-Indo-European and early Carite's thorough remodelling based on noun gender may have contributed to <i>*-ih₂</i> winning over at least several forms of the feminine i-stems. Likewise, the usage of <i>*-ih₂</i> to form feminine forms of u-stems and consonant stems is likely to have reinforced their almost wholesale transfer to i-stems - the transfer of this adjectival usage to nouns was presumably aided by the substantival usage of feminine adjectives and had profound effects on the look of Carite - after all, all <i>*-tis</i> nouns, which were feminine, seem to be continued through Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-tih₂</i>. Some claim that the adoption of a feminine singular <i>*-ih₂</i> would also be aided by the identical neuter plural through analogy with the thematic set.</p>
<p>We may find a noteworthily similar but far from identical parallel in Latin, which similarly remodeled u-stems and consonant stems into i-stems. However, besides the important detail that this only affected adjectives and not the nouns, we fail to find the proliferation of <i>*-ih₂</i>, which instead entirely merged into <i>*-is</i> for adjectives and was extended for nominals (cf. lat@genetrīx < <i>*-ih₂-k-s</i>).</p>

<p>(neuter oxytone endings)</p>
<h3>Nasal Nominals</h3>
<p>The nasal category is made up of the nouns that ended on <i>*-mō</i> and <i>*-mn̥</i>. These nouns are either or masculine; no feminine derivation is attested. Several of the neuter collective forms were reanalysed into masculine nouns before the collective perished and gave way to plural forms that came into being through analogy. It is worth noting that these paradigms did not appear to participate in the radical/oxytonic split - while we can find traces of oxytonic stress through e.g. the effects of Verner's Carite law, it appears the suffixes only reflected a radical accentuation.</p>
<p>Worth noting is the consonant in the ablative, dative and locative plurals, reflecting the deaspiration of <i>*bʰ</i> following nasals, contrasting with the surfacing p in other declensions.</p>

<h2>Pronouns</h2>
<p>Carite pronouns are somewhat innovative when viewed in a European context: it shares with the Celtic language family a levelling of the pronominal nominative according to the oblique stem across all personal pronouns for the first and second persons.</p>
<p>The third person pronouns are related to pclt@es and lat@is. Of note, however, is that they continue the levelling of the nominative according to the accusative like the preceding pronouns did. However, their oblique stems remain separate.</p>
