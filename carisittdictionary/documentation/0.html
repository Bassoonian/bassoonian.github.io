<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Situating the origin of Â§lang_0 is a difficult task. The earliest independent Carite layer is generally dated to 500 BC near Narbonne, France. Given the presence of some PIE roots and formations that are considered to be exclusive to eastern branches, it seems likely the speakers had contact with early instances of Greek and Armenian before migrating further westwards with speakers of what would later become the Celtic language family. Dating the layers of the language's periods of intensive contact with its sister-languages and, later, non-Indo-European peoples is difficult, as much of its early history is obscured by the relative paucity and late attestation of records, but methods of internal reconstruction and comparison of shared innovations help shed some light on Carite's prehistory.</p>

<p>Several of Carite historical processes are firmly dateable to the Common Indo-European period. Thus, their internal history is generally impossible to investigate further.</p>
