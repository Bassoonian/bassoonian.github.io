<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<p>Much of early Carite nominal morphology closely followed the typical western Indo-European model. The declension of nouns and adjectives was closely linked together, and they shared most of their morphology. Degrees of comparison in adjectives have been morphologised for some time, but this comparative system also partook in the normal nominal inflection processes.</p>
<p>Carite nouns distinguished eight cases, the full western Indo-European set, as in Proto-Celtic, but reflected only two numbers, having lost the morphological dual and replacing it thoroughly with the inherited plural. Carite reflected all three genders cleanly at this point, and amplified the distinction between feminines and masculines through inter-paradigmatic analogy. All adjectives tended to reflect all three genders through change of suffix inflection class; the analogical component of gender agreement was much stronger in early Carite than in the roughly contemporaneous Old Latin or Ancient Greek, which still had adjectives that conflated some of the gender categories.</p>
<p>In inflection, Carite nouns also reflect the Indo-European accent system to some extent: nearly all declensional classes (that is, apart from acrostatics) have accent-sensitive declension, with alternative endings for nouns with an etymological oxytonic accent pattern. It's uncertain whether the accent really was still in such a position in early Carite, as the inscriptions are unmarked for stress, but it was certainly on its way out at that point.</p>
<p>In this chapter, the different declension classes in §lang_0 will be discussed first - however, some major innovations or issues common to paradigms will be discussed after in separate chapters. These include the plural suffixes of the genitive, as well as all the oblique plural suffixes. Likewise, the old Proto-Indo-European categories that did not survive will also be described separately.</p>
<h2>Thematic Nominals</h2>
<p>This category of nominals includes o-stems and a-stems and is widely referred to as the thematic set due to the naming conventions of the equivalents of these declension categories in Proto-Indo-European. Some caritologists refer to them as the second and first declension, respectively, after the names in Ancient Greek and Latin.</p>
<h3>O-stems</h3><!--||SOURCE0||-->
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The <b>radical masculine thematic</b> table on the right provides a good starting point for the o-stems. Most of its forms very cleanly continue the Indo-European masculine o-stem inflection: the top three singular forms continue the universally accepted suffixes <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="hovertext" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ος (-os), Latin -us, Proto-Germanic *-az, Armenian -∅"><i>*-os</i></span>, <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="hovertext" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ε (-e), Latin -e, Proto-Germanic *-∅"><i>*-e</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ον (-on), Latin -um, Proto-Germanic *-ą"><i>*-om</i></span>. The genitive singular appears to continue <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ου (-ou, <Proto-Greek *-oyyo), Old Latin -osio, Armenian -ոյ (-oy)"><i>*-osyo</i></span>, which is the pronominal equivalent of the <i>*-os</i> §oxf_intro reconstructs; the <i>-ī</i> that appears in Italo-Celtic is of unknown origin. The long vowels in the ablative and dative singular were presumably already present in Proto-Indo-European <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ō (< Old Latin -ōd)"><i>*-ōd</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ω(ι) (-ō(i)), Latin -ō, Proto-Germanic *-ai"><i>*-ōy</i></span> (where the long vowel is the result of an original <i>**o-e</i> contraction according to §oxf_intro and §compgrammar) - §ed_germanic's ablative suffix, <i>*-ead</i>, is incompatible with the Carite reflex; §compgrammar posits <i>*-ōt</i> instead but remarks that Sabellic has <i>*-ōd</i>, supposedly from <i>**-oVt</i>. The similarity to pie@h₂éd (whence °AD°) is most likely not a coincidence. Additionally, he mentions that the original late form may have been <i>*-ā-</i>, with the substitution with <i>*-ō-</i> being a late analogical development shared with Latin. The locative and instrumental cases also faithfully reflect the Indo-European suffixes <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ī, Armenian -∅"><i>*-oy</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ō"><i>*-oh₁</i></span>, respectively. As pointed out by §compgrammar, <i>*o</i> as thematic vowel for the locative contrasts with the <i>*e</i> found in consonant stems and must be a late development. The plural nominative form does not appear to continue the typical <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Irish -u, Proto-Germanic *-ôz, ?Armenian -ք (-kʿ)"><i>*-ōs</i></span> (again, from an original <i>**-oes</i>) but continues the pronominal suffix <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Irish -∅, Ancient Greek -οι (-oi), Latin -ī (< Old Latin -oe)"><i>*-oy</i></span> of the same usage - this conflation took place in all branches except for Indo-Iranian and Germanic. It is worth noting that, like Old Irish, Carite retained the non-pronominal ending in the vocative plural. The accusative once again faithfully reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ονς (-ons), Latin -ōs, Proto-Germanic *-anz, Armenian -ս (-s)"><i>*-ons</i></span>.</p>
			<p>The <b>oxytonic masculine thematic</b> table, as expected, mostly mirrors its radical equivalent - the only discrepancies are caused by the stressed raising of Pre-§lang_0 <i>*ō</i>. More precisely, the deviating forms are the ablative, dative and instrumental singular as well as the vocative, genitive and instrumental plural forms.</p>

			<p>Most of what needs to be said about the <b>neuter thematic</b> tables - providing a neuter version of the o-stems - has been discussed above; after all, the oblique forms are identical, and we can see that the other three cases all share a suffix.

			<p>The <b>radical feminine thematic</b> table on the left clearly shows that the vowel distribution was significantly simpler in a-stems than in o-stems. The nominative singular form has been discussed above as it is identical to the non-oblique neuter plural forms. Despite also departing from the same <i>*-eh₂</i>, the reflex of the vocative suffix is short rather than the expected long vowel. It appears that in the vocative suffix, the laryngeal was dropped after colouring but before the lengthening - alternatively, one may posit that word-final <i>*-VH</i> only underwent lengthening if the following word started with a consonant (as almost all do), and that the vocative nature separated it from the rest of the clause, thus preventing the lengthening from occurring. It is more than likely that this also happened in the other branches; however, in many cases, the vocative suffix was later made identical to the nominative suffix, undoing this distinction in length. It is not sure if §lang_0 also began this process of analogy - the metre of a specific inscription does in fact point towards a short vowel, however. The accusative in Carite may go back to both <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ην (-ēn), Latin -am, Proto-Germanic -ǭ"><i>*-eh₂m</i></span> or another form with the more regular syllabicisation <i>*-eh₂m̥</i> - the Greek forms require the former, however. This issue appears to be important enough for a reconstruction <i>*-ām</i> to exist (cf. §pie_to_pgmc). The genitive cleanly reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ης (-ēs), arch. Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic -ōz"><i>*-eh₂(e)s</i></span> while the ablative with its word-final dental must reflect a pre-§lang_0 <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ā (< Old Latin -ād)"><i>*-eh₂d</i></span> rather than <i>*-eh₂s</i> - this is clearly a transfer from the o-stems. The dative regularly continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf.

Proto-Germanic *-ō"><i>*-eh₂h₁</i></span> as the reflex of <i>*-eh₂eh₁</i> would be bisyllabic. Unlike the o-stems, a-stems retained their non-pronominal suffix in the nominative plural, continuing <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic -ôz"><i>*-eh₂es</i></span>. Like in the singular, the accusative plural is inconclusive about a possible syllabicisation of the nasal in <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ας (-ās), Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic *-ōz"><i>*-eh₂ms</i></span> - as in the singular, some reconstruct <i>*-āns</i> instead.</p>
			<p>Similar to the o-stems, the <b>oxytonic feminine thematic</b> table on the left is near identical to its radical equivalent. The deviating forms are locative singular, which underwent the raising of long, stressed mid vowels, and the genitive plural.</p>

<h3>Adjectives</h3>
<p>Thematic adjectives were likewise either radical or oxytonic and employed o-stem inflections for the masculine and neuter declensions and a-stem inflections for the feminine declensions. The actual suffixes appear to have been identical, as can be seen below:</p>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_UNSTRESSED_DEF||</br>||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_DEF||
<h2>Iotic Nominals</h2><!--||SOURCE3||-->
<p>The iotic category is made up of i-stem nouns and adjectives. Two things are noteworthy about the iotic nominals in Carite: the proliferation of the <i>*-ih₂</i> paradigm as functional feminine and the almost wholesale absorption of the u-stems and consonant stems. It is very likely these two processes not just happened at the roughly same time, but also reinforced each other: the Proto-Indo-European <i>*-ih₂- ~ *-yeh₂-</i> inflection - referred to as the <i>devī</i> inflection by §compgrammar - was a relatively productive class, forming feminine derivatives of (among others) the athematic stems. For example, for the present participle <i>*-ont-s</i>, we find a feminine in <i>*-ont-ih₂</i> and for u-stem adjectives on <i>*-u-s</i>, we find <i>*(e)w-ih₂</i>. The combination of <i>*-is</i> being identical for both masculine and feminine uses in Proto-Indo-European and early Carite's thorough remodelling based on noun gender may have contributed to <i>*-ih₂</i> winning over at least several forms of the feminine i-stems. Likewise, the usage of <i>*-ih₂</i> to form feminine forms of u-stems and consonant stems is likely to have reinforced their almost wholesale transfer to i-stems - the transfer of this adjectival usage to nouns was presumably aided by the substantival usage of feminine adjectives and had profound effects on the look of Carite - after all, all <i>*-tis</i> nouns, which were feminine, seem to be continued through Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-tih₂</i>. Some claim that the adoption of a feminine singular <i>*-ih₂</i> would also be aided by the identical neuter plural through analogy with the thematic set.</p>
<h3>Nouns</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>As may be seen in the <b>radical masculine iotic</b> table on the right, the masculine i-stems combine retention and innovation. The nominative and accusative singular forms faithfully reflects the typical <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ις (-is), Latin -is, Proto-Germanic *-iz"><i>*-is</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ιν (-in), Latin -em, Proto-Germanic *-į"><i>*-im</i></span>. The Carite vocative either continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ι (-i), ?Proto-Germanic *-i"><i>*-i</i></span> or, significantly less likely, a secondarily shortened full grade <i>*-ey</i>. The genitive likewise regularly continues <i>*-eys</i>, which is the full grade followed by the athematic genitive <i>*-s</i> ending - it is as such unable to continue the o-grade posited by §compgrammar continued in Proto-Germanic <i>*-aiz</i>. As we have seen before, the word-final dental in the ablative <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Latin -īd"><i>**-eyd</i></span> appears to be a contamination from the o-stems attached to the full grade while the dative is the regular unstressed reflex of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="hovertext" title="cf. Latin -ī"><i>*-eyey</i></span>. The locative does not appear to continue <i>*-ēy</i> (from <i>**-ey-i</i>) but continues the bare grade, <i>*-ey</i>, instead, which §pie_to_pgmc posits as secondary reconstruction. Rather than the <i>*-eh₁</i> §compgrammar posits, the Carite instrumental presumably continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ī"><i>*-ih₁</i></span> instead with analogical vocalism as posited by §pie_to_pgmc. In the plural forms, we once again find a regular reflex of unstressed <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf.

			<p>In its oxytonic equivalent, we find several historical retentions of overlong vowels, which were shortened if not stressed. More precisely, we find differences in the dative singular as well as the nominative and vocative plural forms.</p>

			<p>As mentioned above, the Carite feminine i-stems continue a conflation of the i-stems, which were identical for masculine and feminine nouns, and the so-called <i>devī</i> inflection, i.e. the ablauting <i>*-ih₂- ~ *-yeh₂-</i> class. In the <b>radical feminine iotic</b> table on the left, we can see that the nominative singular did continue <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ī"><i>*-ih₂</i></span>. It is more than likely the vocative singular continues the same origin - the short vowel can be attributed to the vocative shortening, either occurring under the same circumstances it did for the a-stems or through analogy with them. The accusative continues <i>*-ih₂m</i> - for the possible syllabicisation of the nasal, please refer to the a-stems. The remaining singular forms are difficult to etymologise - after all, both <i>*-ey-</i>, which would be inherited from the i-stems, and <i>*-ih₂-</i>, which would continue the <i>devī</i> inflection, result in the same outcome. As such, one may only posit with absolute certainty that the oblique forms of the feminine i-stems in Carite perfectly mirrors those of the masculine i-stems. In the plural, we find a continuation of <i>*-ih₂s</i> for the nominative and vocative, while the accusative may either reflect <i>*-ih₂ms</i> - again, please consult the a-stem section regarding the nasal syllabicity - or be the inherited i-stem as can be seen in the masculine i-stem.</p>
			<p>As goes for the masculine i-stem declension in §lang_0, we may find a historical retention of an overlong vowel in the dative singular in the <b>oxytonic feminine iotics</b>; this is the only difference between the radical and oxytonic paradigms.</p>

<h2>Nasal Nominals</h2><!--||SOURCE4||-->
<p>The nasal category is made up of the nouns that ended on <i>*-(m)ō</i> and <i>*-mn̥</i>. These nouns are either or masculine; no feminine derivation is attested - it is likely that any originally feminine n-stems, as they were called in Proto-Indo-European, were remodeled into another class. Several of the neuter collective forms were reanalysed into masculine nouns before the collective perished and gave way to plural forms that came into being through analogy. It is worth noting that these paradigms did not appear to participate in the radical/oxytonic split - while we can find traces of oxytonic stress through e.g. the effects of Verner's Carite law, it appears the suffixes only reflected a radical accentuation.</p>
<p>Worth noting is the consonant in the ablative, dative and locative plurals, reflecting the deaspiration of <i>*bʰ</i> following nasals, contrasting with the surfacing <i>p</i> in other declensions.</p>
<div class="container">

<h2>Remodelled paradigms</h2>
<h3>Root formations</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>U-stems</h3>
<p>We may find a noteworthily similar but far from identical parallel in Latin, which similarly remodeled u-stems and consonant stems into i-stems. However, besides the important detail that this only affected adjectives and not the nouns, we fail to find the proliferation of <i>*-ih₂</i>, which instead entirely merged into <i>*-is</i> for adjectives and was extended for nominals (cf. lat@genetrīx < <i>*-ih₂-k-s</i>).</p>
<h3>R-stems</h3>
<p>The kinship terms in <i>*-ter-</i> appear to have been thematicised into <i>*-tros</i> and <i>*-treh₂</i> depending on noun gender; for example, for pie@ph₂tḗr and pie@méh₂tēr, we find °PATER° and °MATER° respectively, with the voiced dental in the word for "father" being an indication of the retention of suffixal stress through Verner's Carite Law. Likewise but without the dental, we find °TAIKWER° for an original pie@dayh₂wḗr, with the zero grade making the preceding semivowel syllabic.</p>
<p>As a formal variation on the group above, we find the Proto-Indo-European suffixes <i>*-tōr</i> and <i>*-trih₂</i> - given the proliferation of i-stems as discussed above and with such obvious analogical opportunity, it should come at no surprise that the masculine suffix was reformed into <i>*-tris</i> in §lang_0.</p>
<p>In other words, often zero grades, we find a thematicised full grade. The word for star, °ASTER° (< pie@h₂stḗr), appears to reflect <i>*-ereh₂</i> while °STARLING° (< pie@spḗr) appears to continue <i>*-eros</i>. pie@h₂nḗr, on the other hand, appears to be continued in °NERO°, where the suffix also appears in a zero grade.</p>
<h3>R/N-stems</h3>
<p>In some Indo-European languages, we find a class of neuter nouns ending on <i>*-r</i> but with other cases being built off <i>*-n-</i>, hence the name. By late Proto-Indo-European times, this rather archaic and closed category was already well on its way out, being variously remodeled in different means, sometimes through different means for the same word in the same language. Carite appears to have primarily thematicised these by appending <i>*-om</i> to this original rhotic suffix - as such, we may find °PALMSOLE° for pie@dʰénr̥ and °SPRINGSEASON° for pie@wésr̥. On the other hand, we find e.g. °BLOOD° continuing a derivation through the oblique suffix with the nasal (besides its more expected reflex °SANIES°).</p>
<h3>N-stems</h3>
<p>As discussed above, only two categories of n-stems appear to have survived into Carite. Masculine <i>*-ō</i>, arguably one of the most widespread n-stem formations survived (with its feminine equivalent having been iotacised); its far less widespread e-grade equivalent, <i>*-ēn</i>, appears to have been remodeled inconsistently, with °UKSEN° showing remodeling as <i>*-ō</i> but °BRANI° showing remodeling as <i>*-nis</i> - °VENA° (< pie@gʷḗn) curiously enough was thematicised as <i>*-eneh₂</i> rather than as an i-stem as one might expect.</p>
<h3>M-stems</h3>
<p>Proto-Indo-European appears to have possessed a handful of m-stems, all feminine. Once again, it comes to no surprise that these were reformed as feminine iotics in §lang_0: °EARTH° continues pie@dʰéǵʰōm (with <i>*-mih₂</i> for <i>*-ōm</i>) while °WINTER° continues pie@ǵʰéyōm (with the vocalism being the result of Schwebeablaut?).</p>
<h3>S-stems</h3>
<p>As we have seen before, neuter s-stems are regularly continued in the acrostatic class. The few surviving masculine and feminine nouns, which were significantly less widespread, underwent thematicisation (?)</p>
<h3>Other archaic formations</h3>
<h2>Genitive plural suffixes</h2>
<p>While the long vowel of the genitive plural suffix is incompatible with §oxf_intro's <i>*-om</i> (and positing <i>**-o-em</i> would be baseless here), it the expected reflex of both <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ων (-ōn), Latin -[ōr]um"><i>*-ōm</i></span> as posited by §compgrammar and of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ǫ̂"><i>*-(o)ohₓom</i></span> as posited by §ed_germanic.</p><!--O STEM-->
<p>The genitive plural appears to be identical to the o-stems. It is likely that it contained <i>*-eh₂-</i> plus whichever form the o-stems are derived from and the resulting sequence <i>**-aōm</i> contracted, possibly through analogy with the o-stems. Similar constructions are attest in the other languages; Ancient Greek and Latin, however, had pronominal contamination. ... which helps us posit two theories about its origin: either the entire suffix was transferred from the o-stems after the the raising of long stressed mid vowels, or the <i>*-á-</i> that presumably preceded it earlier had already undergone contraction with the adjacent long vowel before the raising occurred.</p><!--A STEM-->
<h3>Oblique plural suffixes</h3>
<p>§oxf_intro's reconstructions for the remaining forms, being <i>*-om</i>, <i>*-oybʰ(y)os ~ *-omus</i>, <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -οισι (-oisi)"><i>*-oysu</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -οις (-ois), Latin -īs (< Old Latin -eis)"><i>-*ōys</i></span> must be discarded in a Carite context - the same goes for §ed_germanic's <i>*-o(y)mos</i> for dative and ablative and its locative and instrumental suffixes, which are identical to §oxf_intro's.</p><!-- O STEM-->
<p>Like in the o-stems, the remaining plural suffixes are harder to find clear cognates for, although the instrumental plural suffix <i>*-eh₂bʰi</i> posited by §oxf_intro and §pie_to_pgmc seems relevant.</p><!--A STEM-->
<h2>Comparatives & Superlatives</h2>
<p>Comparative: -yōs > -(j)ōs, superlative: -istm̥(m)os > -istumos</p>
<h2>Numerals</h2>
<p>As in Proto-Indo-European, the numerals for one, two and three are inflected for gender and case while the numeral for four has generalised the nominative neuter form and become uninflected like the numbers that follow it.</p>

Likewise, °3° faithfully follows the oxytonic plural inflection of the iotic nominals. It is worth noting that these did not agree in number - when referring to a noun in the plural but with a singular meaning, the numeral for one strictly continues the paradigm presented here and does not employ the plural suffixes we find in the radical thematic paradigm.</p>

<h2>Pronouns</h2>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<h4>First and second</h4>
<p>Carite pronouns are somewhat innovative when viewed in a European context: it shares with the Celtic language family a levelling of the pronominal nominative according to the oblique stem across all personal pronouns for the first and second persons. Most forms distinguish between a stressed an an unstressed form, where the unstressed forms continue the Proto-Indo-European clitics. The default usage of pronouns is unstressed, where independent stressed pronouns are disjunctive and empathic. Additionally, monosyllabic propositions require accented pronouns whereas polysyllabic ones require unaccented ones. Further choice is pragmatic.</p>
<h4>Third</h4>
<p>The third person pronouns are related to pclt@es and lat@is. Of note, however, is that they continue the levelling of the nominative according to the accusative like the preceding pronouns did. However, their oblique stems remain separate.</p>
