<h1>External Interactions</h1>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>As a people with settlements on the Mediterreanean coast, it comes to no surprise the early Carites had contact with other ancient nations and took part in their trading network. As such, we find words of various foreign origins that were loaned around this time, either presumably or with absolute certainty, from languages such as Ancient Greek and Etruscan, but also from Phoenician and Egyptian. Several words do not have a satisfactory etymology but are similar to words of the same meaning in other languages - these words are commonly ascribed to be Mediterranean Wanderworts and are not discussed here.</p>
<h2>Ancient Greek</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned in the orthography chapter, the Carite people had close contact with the Ancient Greeks, both those who settled around them and those only encountered by trade. Interestingly enough, the origin of the loans appear to confirm this distinction, with a vast majority of the loans coming from the neighbouring Ionians while many of the more trade-oriented loans show Doric characteristics.</p>
<p>The Ancient Greek phonological inventory features fewer sounds not native to §lang_0 than vice-versa. The aspirated series in Greek, i.e. /pʰ tʰ kʰ/, appears to have been loaned as their tenuis equivalents in Carite; for example, we find °ANETOM° from grc@ἄνηθον=ánēton. The unvoiced allophone of Greek /r/ - [r̥] - is simply loaned as if it were regular voiced rhotic; as such, we find °RHISKOS° for grc@ῥίσκος=rhískos. While Greek [z] was presumably limited to an allophone status in 500 BC, its phonemic status in §lang_0 meant it was most likely simply borrowed as /z/ - however, we are unable to find any Greek word with this sound in Carite.</p>
<p>In terms of vowels, the Greek phonemic status of /ɛː ɔː/, although only appearing as long vowels, does not appear to be reflected in Carite, where they are generally simply borrowed as long mid vowels; we find e.g. grc@ποτήρῐον=potḗrion reflected in Carite as °POTERJOM°. Greek <υ>, which is most commonly known for representing [y], was in all likelihood still [u] during the borrowing of Greek loans from this period: after all, they surface as /u/ in Carite despite the presence of /yː/. As such, we find °CYPRESS° from grc@κυπάρισσος=kupárissos.</p>
<p>In several cases, we find apparent deviations from these straightforward loans. The first is that occasionally, /ɛː/ was borrowed as /iː/. This only occurs in Greek second declension nouns, where the vowel shift from an original /aː/ led to these words being borrowed as feminine i-stems in §lang_0. An example is °AGORA° from grc@ἀγορή=agorḗ. Another significant deviation can be found in the seemingly arbitrary voicing of some consonants and clusters. However, this can be easily attributed to these words being borrowed before Verner's Carite law went into effect; after all, these all represent onsets of syllables that received accent in Greek. This is already apparent in multiple examples given above.</p>

<h2>Etruscan</h2>

<h2>Substrate</h2>
<p>Several words in Carite lack any etymology and may be of an original substrate origin. However, as practically none of these words have cognates in other languages, it is almost impossible to reconstruct this hypothetical substrate language to any degree.</p>
