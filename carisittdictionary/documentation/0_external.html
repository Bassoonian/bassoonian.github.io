<h1>External Interactions</h1>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>As a people with settlements on the Mediterreanean coast, it comes to no surprise the early Carites had contact with other ancient nations and took part in their trading network. As such, we find words of various foreign origins that were loaned around this time, either presumably or with absolute certainty, from languages such as Ancient Greek and Etruscan, but also from Phoenician and Egyptian. Several words do not have a satisfactory etymology but are similar to words of the same meaning in other languages - these words are commonly ascribed to be Mediterranean Wanderworts and are not discussed here.</p>
<h2>Ancient Greek</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned in the orthography chapter, the Carite people had close contact with the Ancient Greeks, both those who settled around them and those only encountered by trade. Interestingly enough, the origin of the loans appear to confirm this distinction, with a vast majority of the loans coming from the neighbouring Ionians while many of the more trade-oriented loans show Doric characteristics.</p>
<p>The Ancient Greek phonological inventory features fewer sounds not native to §lang_0 than vice-versa. The aspirated series in Greek, i.e. /pʰ tʰ kʰ/, appears to have been loaned as their tenuis equivalents in Carite; for example, we find °ANETOM° from grc@ἄνηθον=ánēton. The unvoiced allophone of Greek /r/ - [r̥] - is simply loaned as if it were regular voiced rhotic; as such, we find °RHISKOS° for grc@ῥίσκος=rhískos. While Greek [z] was presumably limited to an allophone status in 500 BC, its phonemic status in §lang_0 meant it was most likely simply borrowed as /z/ - however, we are unable to find any Greek word with this sound in Carite.</p>
<p>In terms of vowels, the Greek phonemic status of /ɛː ɔː/, although only appearing as long vowels, does not appear to be reflected in Carite, where they are generally simply borrowed as long mid vowels; we find e.g. grc@ποτήρῐον=potḗrion reflected in Carite as °POTERJOM°. Greek <<υ>>, which is most commonly known for representing [y], was in all likelihood still [u] during the borrowing of Greek loans from this period: after all, they surface as /u/ in Carite despite the presence of /yː/; As such, we find °CYPRESS° from grc@κυπάρισσος=kupárissos.</p>
<p>In several cases, we find apparent deviations from these straightforward loans. The first is that occasionally, /ɛː/ was borrowed as /iː/. This only occurs in Greek second declension nouns, where the vowel shift from an original /aː/ led to these words being borrowed as feminine i-stems in §lang_0. An example is °AGORA° from grc@ἀγορή=agorḗ. Another significant deviation can be found in the seemingly arbitrary voicing of some consonants and clusters. However, this can be easily attributed to these words being borrowed before Verner's Carite law went into effect; after all, these all represent onsets of syllables that received accent in Greek. This is already apparent in multiple examples given above.</p>
<h2>Egyptian</h2>
<h2>Etruscan</h2>
<p>The exact reconstructed phonological inventory of Etruscan is not entirely agreed upon and Etruscan loans into Carite appear to be relatively ambiguous. The <i>communis opinio</i> holds that in terms of obstruents, Etruscan contained three series: /p t k/, /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ and /f s š/. The alternative model replaces the aspirated seres by a palatalised one, i.e. /pʲ tʲ tˢ/ (with the last coming from */kʲ/), while expanding the fricative inventory with /θ x/. For further information about these contesting reconstructions, please refer to §etruscan_rix as anything not pertinent to Carite will not be included here. There are relatively few §lang_0 words of Etruscan origin and as such, they remain relatively unimportant to etruscologists.</p>
<p>While Etruscan obstruents are phonemically voiceless, they appear to have been realised as lenes word-internally. We find proof of this in Latin transcriptions, such as <i>Tidi</i> for <i>Titi</i>, but also in Carite loans with ett@𐌂𐌋𐌉𐌔𐌖=clisu being borrowed as °CLISU°, for example. Etruscan aspirates (or palatalised stops as discussed above), as in Greek, may have been loaned as plain voiceless stops: we find °PERZO° for ett@𐌘𐌄𐌓𐌔𐌖=φersu. We find °WAKROM° reflecting ett@𐌅𐌀𐌙𐌓=vaχr - this may either be a lenis [gʰ] allophone or, in the case of a reconstruction of <<χ>> as /x/, the nearest Carite approximation of [ɣ]. The possibly ambiguous value of <<θ>> - being either /tʰ/ or /θ/ - remains ambiguous as is: the only word containing such sounds that is borrowed into Carite, i.e. ett@𐌈𐌀𐌚𐌍𐌀=θafna, yielded °TAFNA° (/p/ for Etruscan /f/ means this word was borrowed after /f/ was fortified before sonorants). No Etruscan words with /š/ or the possible sound /tˢ/ appear to have been borrowed.</p>
<p>When it comes to sonorants, Etruscan seemed to possess the same /m n l r/ inventory as §lang_0. The lateral may have had a velar allophone [ɫ] when following /a/; this appears to have been inconsequential in its Carite adoptal with ett@𐌔𐌅𐌀𐌋𐌀𐌔=svalas simply yielding °SVALAS°. While glides occurred as allophones of the high vowels /i u/, they appear to have received phonemic treatment as can be seen in the example above.</p>
<p>While Etruscan lacked /o/, this appears to not have been much of a problem as §lang_0 phonemically possessed the other four vowels, i.e. /i u e a/. In contrast to §lang_0, Etruscan vowels had no phonemic vowel length; however, vowels were lengthened phonetically when accented - in most of the cases, this would be when in the first syllable - or in word-final position. While loans into Carite may not prove the latter, we do find this allophonic lengthening phonemicised as evident by the examples above - the apparent exception in °PERZO° is regular due to Osthoff's Law.</p>
<h2>Phoenician</h2>
<h2>Substrate</h2>
<p>Several words in Carite lack any etymology and may be of an original substrate origin. However, as practically none of these words have cognates in other languages, it is almost impossible to reconstruct this hypothetical substrate language to any degree.</p>
