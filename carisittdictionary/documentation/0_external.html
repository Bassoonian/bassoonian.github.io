<h1>External Interactions</h1>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>As a people with settlements on the Mediterreanean coast, it comes to no surprise the early Carites had contact with other ancient nations and took part in their trading network. As such, we find words of various foreign origins that were loaned around this time, either presumably or with absolute certainty, from languages such as Ancient Greek and Etruscan, but also from Phoenician and Egyptian. Several words do not have a satisfactory etymology but are similar to words of the same meaning in other languages - these words are commonly ascribed to be Mediterranean Wanderworts and are not discussed here.</p>
<h2>Ancient Greek</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned in the orthography chapter, the Carite people had close contact with the Ancient Greeks, both those who settled around them and those only encountered by trade. Interestingly enough, the origin of the loans appear to confirm this distinction, with a vast majority of the loans coming from the neighbouring Ionians while many of the more trade-oriented loans show Doric characteristics.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>The Ancient Greek phonological inventory features fewer sounds not native to §lang_0 than vice-versa. The aspirated series in Greek, i.e. /pʰ tʰ kʰ/, appears to have been loaned as their tenuis equivalents in Carite; for example, we find °ANETOM° from grc@ἄνηθον=ánēton. The unvoiced allophone of Greek /r/ - [r̥] - is simply loaned as if it were regular voiced rhotic; as such, we find °RHISKOS° for grc@ῥίσκος=rhískos. While Greek [z] was presumably limited to an allophone status in 500 BC, its phonemic status in §lang_0 meant it was most likely simply borrowed as /z/ - however, we are unable to find any Greek word with this sound in Carite.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>In terms of vowels, the Greek phonemic status of /ɛː ɔː/, although only appearing as long vowels, does not appear to be reflected in Carite, where they are generally simply borrowed as long mid vowels; we find e.g. grc@ποτήρῐον=potḗrion reflected in Carite as °POTERJOM°. Greek <<υ>>, which is most commonly known for representing [y], was in all likelihood still [u] during the borrowing of Greek loans from this period: after all, they surface as /u/ in Carite despite the presence of /yː/; As such, we find °CYPRESS° from grc@κυπάρισσος=kupárissos. </p>
<h3>Other developments</h3>
<p>In several cases, we find apparent deviations from these straightforward loans. The first is that occasionally, /ɛː/ was borrowed as /iː/. This only occurs in Greek second declension nouns, where the vowel shift from an original /aː/ led to these words being borrowed as feminine i-stems in §lang_0. An example is °AGORA° from grc@ἀγορή=agorḗ. Another significant deviation can be found in the seemingly arbitrary voicing of some consonants and clusters. However, this can be easily attributed to these words being borrowed before Verner's Carite law went into effect; after all, these all represent onsets of syllables that received accent in Greek. This is already apparent in multiple examples given above.</p>
<h2>Egyptian</h2>
<p>As is common knowledge, Egyptian was spoken for an incredibly long amount of time and the pronunciation without a doubt varied depending on the time period. In contrast with Phoenician, which is discussed below, Egyptian phonology is significantly harder to reconstruct. The fact only a handful of §lang_0 nouns are of Egyptian origin makes discussing the entire phonology rather irrelevant and as such, this section will solely discuss the behaviour of sounds represented in loans from Egyptian in §lang_0.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>When it comes to stops, we only find /b/ represented in loans into Carite, i.e. °NOBOM° from legp@𓋞=nbw (among others). It is not clear if this /b/ was pronounced [β] during the contact with the Carites as it did later, but the fact it was borrowed as /b/ rather than /v/ (or arguably /w/) points towards a status of [b]. °BAJNA°'s origin, legp@𓃀𓇋𓈖𓏏𓆱=bjnt, originally possessed a /t/, which functioned as feminine marker and was dropped in favour of a native feminine suffix; according to §ltlu, this plosive was presumably no longer pronounced well before the earliest contact between the two peoples. The fricatives are represented slightly better. °CONSTELLATION° from legp@𓋴𓃀𓄿𓇼𓇳𓏏=sbꜣwt shows /s/ while °HOPPER° from legp@𓊃𓈖𓎛𓅓𓆧=znḥmw reflects an original /z/ which had fully merged into Egyptian /s/ prior to contact with the Carites. An original /ʀ/, romanised as <<ꜣ>>, had gone through /ʔ/ before outright disappearing altogether, explaining its absence in °CONSTELLATION°, which comes from legp@𓋴𓃀𓄿𓇼𓇳𓏏=sbꜣwt. /h χ/ (the latter being romanised as <<ḫ>>) both were presumably loaned as a plain /h/ but as a matter of fact, the latter may have merged into /h/ in Egyptian prior to or during the contact period. °IBIS° from legp@𓉔𓃀𓏭𓅝=hbj had an original /h/ and this is still visible word-initially; in °HOPPER° (from legp@𓊃𓈖𓎛𓅓𓆧=znḥmw) we find no reflex of this sound which is easily explainable through §lang_0's limitation of /h/ to word-initial environments.</p>
<p>While we do not find any liquids in loans from Egyptian, the nasals are represented in °HOPPER°, which has both. Written word-final glides, such as in legp@𓋞=nbw and legp@𓉔𓃀𓏭𓅝=hbj, were dropped well before contact with the Carites, which explains why these sounds do not appear in °NOBOM° and °IBIS°, respectively. This only leaves the glide in legp@𓃀𓇋𓈖𓏏𓆱=bjnt, which we cleanly find reflected in °BAJNA°, and in legp@𓋴𓃀𓄿𓇼𓇳𓏏=sbꜣwt, where we likewise find it reflected in °CONSTELLATION°.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>The vowels are slightly harder to reconstruct as they remain unwritten; this aspect is well beyond the scope of this page and will not be discussed here (for more information, please refer to §intro_egyptian and §ltlu); rather, comparisons shall be drawn between a hypothetical Egyptian pronunciation and the way the word was loaned into §lang_0.</p>
<p>legp@𓃀𓇋𓈖𓏏𓆱=bjnt was most likely pronounced as /bajnə/ during the contact with Carite, which makes the vowel in the first syllable of °BAJNA° very logical; as mentioned above, the classification as a-stem was presumably to mirror the feminine gender of the word, but as we will see below, the interpretation of Egyptian /ə/ in Carite may very likely have been /a/, which would only reinforce this classification. legp@𓉔𓃀𓏭𓅝=hbj may have stood for /hiːb/, which matches °IBIS°. The classification as i-stem may have been the result of euphony. legp@𓋞=nbw presumably represented /nuːb/, which matches the vocalism of °NOBOM°. legp@𓊃𓈖𓎛𓅓𓆧=znḥmw may have been /sənheːm/, where we find Carite /a/ for Egyptian /ə/ in °HOPPER° as mentioned above. The stress was presumably on the long vowel in Egyptian - the fact we do not find *ī in Carite means the word must have been borrowed after the stressed vowel raising. °CONSTELLATION° presupposes a /siːb-/ onset in legp@𓋴𓃀𓄿𓇼𓇳𓏏=sbꜣwt, while the classification as i-stem may be euphony as was the case for £IBIS£ above.</p>
<h2>Etruscan</h2>
<p>The exact reconstructed phonological inventory of Etruscan is not entirely agreed upon and Etruscan loans into Carite appear to be relatively ambiguous. The <i>communis opinio</i> holds that in terms of obstruents, Etruscan contained three series: /p t k/, /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ and /f s š/. The alternative model replaces the aspirated seres by a palatalised one, i.e. /pʲ tʲ tˢ/ (with the last coming from */kʲ/), while expanding the fricative inventory with /θ x/. For further information about these contesting reconstructions, please refer to §etruscan_rix as anything not pertinent to Carite will not be included here. There are relatively few §lang_0 words of Etruscan origin and as such, they remain relatively unimportant to etruscologists.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>While Etruscan obstruents are phonemically voiceless, they appear to have been realised as lenes word-internally. We find proof of this in Latin transcriptions, such as <i>Tidi</i> for <i>Titi</i>, but also in Carite loans with ett@𐌂𐌋𐌉𐌔𐌖=clisu being borrowed as °CLISU°, for example. Etruscan aspirates (or palatalised stops as discussed above), as in Greek, may have been loaned as plain voiceless stops: we find °PERZO° for ett@𐌘𐌄𐌓𐌔𐌖=φersu. We find °WAKROM° reflecting ett@𐌅𐌀𐌙𐌓=vaχr - this may either be a lenis [gʰ] allophone or, in the case of a reconstruction of <<χ>> as /x/, the nearest Carite approximation of [ɣ]. The possibly ambiguous value of <<θ>> - being either /tʰ/ or /θ/ - remains ambiguous as is: the only word containing such sounds that is borrowed into Carite, i.e. ett@𐌈𐌀𐌚𐌍𐌀=θafna, yielded °TAFNA° (/p/ for Etruscan /f/ means this word was borrowed after /f/ was fortified before sonorants). No Etruscan words with /š/ or the possible sound /tˢ/ appear to have been borrowed.</p>
<p>When it comes to sonorants, Etruscan seemed to possess the same /m n l r/ inventory as §lang_0. The lateral may have had a velar allophone [ɫ] when following /a/; this appears to have been inconsequential in its Carite adoptal with ett@𐌔𐌅𐌀𐌋𐌀𐌔=svalas simply yielding °SVALAS°. While glides occurred as allophones of the high vowels /i u/, they appear to have received phonemic treatment as can be seen in the example above.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>While Etruscan lacked /o/, this appears to not have been much of a problem as §lang_0 phonemically possessed the other four vowels, i.e. /i u e a/. In contrast to §lang_0, Etruscan vowels had no phonemic vowel length; however, vowels were lengthened phonetically when accented - in most of the cases, this would be when in the first syllable - or in word-final position. While loans into Carite may not prove the latter, we do find this allophonic lengthening phonemicised as evident by the examples above - the apparent exception in °PERZO° is regular due to Osthoff's Law.</p>
<h2>Phoenician</h2>
<p>As another major force when it comes to Mediterranean trade, contact with the Phoenicians from Carthage appeared to have been significant - in fact, we even find back °CARTHAGE° from xpu@𐤒𐤓‎𐤕𐤇𐤃‎𐤔𐤕=qrtḥdšt to refer to the city. As is the case for Etruscan, the precise phonology of Phoenician is not entirely certain - the highly historical nature of its orthography is all but helpful - and the majority of our knowledge depends on their interaction with the Romans. As the contact between §lang_0 and Punic preceded this period, several differences may occur.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>The Phoenician consonant inventory differed significantly from §lang_0's and as such, additional elaboration for many sounds is mandatory. For example, Phoenician's unvoiced stop inventory consists of /p t ʈ k q ʡ ʔ/, boasting four more stops than §lang_0. Most of these stops additionally deviate from what one would expect: /p/ seems to have been varying between [p ~ f] before the latter became normative in Neo-Punic. We appear to mainly find these borrowed as Carite /f/ as can be seen in the name of the Punic language, °PUNIC° from xpu@𐤐𐤍‎(𐤉)𐤌=pn(y)m. /t/ was presumably slightly aspirated as evidenced by its indication of <<θ>> and <<th>> in Greek and Latin, respectively, but as we previously saw in Greek (and possibly Etruscan), unvoiced aspirates were loaned as plain stops. While /ʈ/ was contrasted with this in Greek and Latin, where it was borrowed as an unaspirated stop, it merged entirely into /t/ in §lang_0; an example is °OPITAR° from xpu@𐤏𐤐𐤕_𐤇𐤓𐤑=ʿpt_ḥrṣ. /k/ most definitely represented [kʰ] in Neo-Punic but the nature of its aspiration before then is uncertain; once again, this is irrelevant to the outcome in Carite as can be seen in the word for Carthage, °CARTHAGE°. The uvular stop /q/ was borrowed as a plain /k/ into Carite, sharing its fate with Greek and Latin; an example is °REKA° from xpu@𐤓𐤒‎𐤇=rqḥ. It is quite likely /ʡ/ had already entirely disappeared by the time of the contact with the Carites; either way, it was never integrated into loans as is evident in °OPITAR° (see above). The first letter of Punic's alphabet, <<𐤀>>, originally represented a glottal stop /ʔ/ in onsets but lengthened preceding vowels in coda positions. §gram_punic mentions that the stop was no longer pronounced in Neo-Punic - whether this was the case during the contact with the Carites is uncertain as it is very feasible for a glottal stop to be lost when borrowed by a language that does not possess it phonemically. An example is °UKNUI° from xpu@𐤀𐤒𐤍𐤀=ʾqnʾ. When it comes to the voiced stops, we find the more familiar /b d g/. The bilabial plosive in all likelihood had a preconsonantal allophone [v] in Neo-Punic times; however, we find no such sequence in any of the words loaned into Carite; in fact, °LEBONA° from xpu@𐤋‎𐤁𐤍𐤕=lbnt is one of the few words loaned to contain /b/ at all. /d/ appeared to have represented simply [d] and was evidently loaned as such; the same goes for /g/. For example, we find °GADOM° from xpu@𐤂𐤃=gd and °MGRD° from xpu@𐤌𐤂‎𐤓𐤃=mgrd (with analogical devoicing of the dental; refer to the entry for more information).</p>
<p>Matching the Greek <<ζ>>, Phoenician possessed a <<𐤆>> which was presumably either [zd] or [dz] as affricate originally. We know that this affricate was reduced to a single sibilant, possibly originally to [z] but in all likelihood to [s] in Neo-Punic. Its unvoiced equivalent, /ts/, merged with simple /s/ in late Neo-Punic but must have retained its original value in 500 BC; however, it appeared to have been borrowed as a simple /s/ word-initially and next to another consonant as can be seen in °SEPOROS° from xpu@𐤑𐤐‎𐤓=ṣpr and °EGYPT° from xpu@𐤌𐤑𐤓𐤌=mṣrm. The phonemic fricative inventory sports a relatively straightforward /s h ħ/ set. /s/ was mainly represented by <<𐤎>> but also by <<𐤔>>, which had merged into /s/ very early onwards but which was retained orthographically. /h/ was entirely lost in the Neo-Punic period, as is the case for /ħ/, but both seem to be reflected in Carite as /h/; examples include °HARES° from 𐤇𐤓‎𐤔‎=ḥrš. The sonorant inventory alongside the glides is significantly more straightforward with its /m n l r w j/, which all seemed to be reflected as such phonetically. An example is °LEPRA° from xpu@𐤌𐤑𐤓‎(𐤓‎)𐤏=mṣr(r)ʿ. </p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>Contrasting with its rather large consonant inventory, Phoenician vowels were very straightforward, albeit harder to identify due to their lack of notation. The usual five-vowel system /a e i o u/ marks all short vowels, while the long vowels /iː oː uː/ enriched this set; all were loaned as their phonemic equivalents in §lang_0. The exact nature of the contracted diphthongs, usually represented as <<ê ô>>, is unknown; however, they were borrowed as a plain /eː oː/.</p>
<h3>Other developments</h3>
<p>As we observed earlier in Greek loans, Verner's law appears to have been phonemicised late enough for many loans to have undergone this change and Punic loans were no exception. As stress was word-final in almost all cases, this proved to be particularly fruitful.[?]</p>
<h2>Unknown substrates</h2>
<p>Several words in Carite lack any etymology and may be of an original substrate origin. However, as practically none of these words have cognates in other languages, it is almost impossible to reconstruct this hypothetical substrate language to any degree.</p>
