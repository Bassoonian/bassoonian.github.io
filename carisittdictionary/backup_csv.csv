,,,!allophony,"Likely the earliest traditionally dateable sound change in Carite, and in Indo-European in general, is <b>laryngeal colouring</b>. As its traces can be seen even across Anatolian, it is likely that an allophonic process of vowel colouring next to the traditionally posited laryngeals <i>*h₂ *h₃</i> predates the Anatolian split. This had little effect on the morphology of Indo-European early on, and only later did it influence its grammatical ablaut. A generalised overview of the process:|-|Two things are notable about this change. The first is that, as in other Indo-European languages, the effects of laryngeal colouring are recoverable only for the vowel <i>*e</i>, and not any other vowel; whether this is due to its effect only on this vowel, or that the effects of colouring on other vowels were lost, is indeterminable. The second is that, after this change, we cannot reliably distinguish in Carite history the laryngeals <i>*h₁</i> and <i>*h₂</i> later in time; one theory states that might have merged at some point immediately after colouring effects took place, phonemicising the vowel colour, and another that they remained distinguished, but that sound changes treated them the same due to their phonetic and phonological similarity.",,,,"According to some, Carite also coloured <i>*a</i> next to <i>*h₃</i>:|-|According to those in favour, the colouring of <i>*e</i> next to two different colouring laryngeals can be predicted if the colouring was a two-step process; first, <i>*h₂</i> would colour <i>*e</i> to an <i>*a</i>, and this <i>*a</i> would be coloured to <i>*o</i> (alongside uncoloured <i>*e</i>) next to <i>*h₃</i>. However, this environment only appears to appear in a single word (pie@h₂eh₃mós, whence °OOMOS°), which makes it likely another more mainstream explanation can be found.</p><p>It is worth noting that while the Latin and Greek reflexes of <i>*h₂o</i> appear to be either /o/ or /a/, Carite appears to simply reflect <i>*o</i> for these cases.",,!applyalways,"<b>Voicing assimilation</b> in obstruent clusters is another extremely early Indo-European phenomenon. It predates all the other recoverable processes, and its age relative to laryngeal colouring cannot be determined. The process dictates the spread of voicing from the final element in a cluster regressively.",,"This change also operated when the cluster included aspirates: they can be assumed to also be voiced, or breathily/partially voiced, to begin with. All aspirates in such clusters presumably become voiceless aspirates, but their result cannot be shown to be different from regular voiced obstruents: presumably, this aspiration is lost early enough internally to merge their outcome with that of regular <i>tenues</i>, and not (the somewhat later) voiceless aspirates.","This was later generalised to all aspirates before a plosive:|-|This assimilation happened both at morpheme boundaries, and morpheme-internally (especially when triggered by ablaut):</p><pre>*ni-sᵒd-ós > °NIZDOS°</pre><p>The voiced consonants produced by this change were generally allophonic, only to phonemicise later when their morphophonological environment became irrecoverable.","A somewhat later process, <b>Siebs' law</b>, changed this system after the rise and proliferation of prefixed s-mobile. Word-initial clusters with |*sB *sBʰ|, formed morphologically, would devoice, possibly giving rise to a new set of voiceless aspirates, in addition to adding to a growing number of voiceless tenues:|-|It is not clear if the voiceless aspirates remained phonemic for long - in any case, in Carite, they behave identically to the regular voiceless tenues and presumably merged shortly after if they ever were distinct in the first place. Two other large, early processes involving /*s/ took place at roughly the same time.","The first was the dissolution of <b>thorn clusters</b>; all clusters that were underlyingly a sequence of an alveolar and velar plosive were already slightly affricated in earlier Indo-European times (reflected in xlu@īnzagan-, presumably underlyingly /-dzg-/, but not reflected, or possibly undone, in Hittite), but the development of these clusters after the split of Anatolian and Tocharian languages from the main phylum sets the late Common Indo-European group, together with Carite, apart from earlier Indo-European. In Carite, the thorn clusters underwent metathesis and deaffrication:|-|The reflex of |*T{g,ǵ}(ʷ)ʰ| as [*{g,ǵ}(ʷ)ʰz] is actually expected, since the first part of the intermediate step cluster |*dʰg(ʷ)ʰ| (after assimilation) is predictably deaspirated before a plosive, and is then affricated and metathesised.",,,,,,,,,"The <b>degemination of dentals</b> happened similarly to Greek; the first dental (i.e. alveolar plosive) was affricated, and then the resulting cluster was simplified:|-|This process probably only happened only at morpheme boundaries: the pie@átta was preserved seemingly unaltered. It is possible that the word had some other process at play, or that it was a babbled word or a loan common to Indo-European; regardless, the process continued to be a productive morphophonological alternation.",!applyalways,"Another early process in Carite history, shared with the majority of Indo-European languages, is <b>Osthoff's law</b>, which dictates the shortening of sequences of long vowels followed by a resonant and another, indeterminate consonant:|-|Osthoff's sequences shortened both internally and finally, and—crucial for dating the change—also happened before laryngeals that were later lost. It is especially important in Carite, being an active surface filter for a greater length of time.","The first big loss of laryngeals (<b>first laryngeal loss</b>) happened immediately after Osthoff's law took place. It dictated the loss of some interconsonantal laryngeals, operating in two different directions:|-|The inherited Indo-European sequences of the type <i>*ōRHC</i> (including the diphthongs <i>*ōy *ōw</i>, and others) were already shortened and merged into sequences of the type <i>*oRHC</i> due to Osthoff's law.",,"Centumisation in Carite took place somewhat late, and only after the <b>coalescence</b> of a sequence of a back velar followed by *w into a single labiovelar consonant:|-|Some fringe linguists hypothesise that this change also affected the laryngeal sequence <i>*h₂w > *h₃</i>, citing late-attested forms such as <i>??</i> (from <i>*???</i>) and <i>??</i> (hypothetically from <i>*???</i>, though this etymology is controversial). Others dismiss this assumption and claim that <i>*h₂</i> had by then merged already with <i>*h₁</i> and that it is indistinguishable from it in these contexts.",,,,"Centumisation proper happened quite similarly to how it played out in Greek and Italo-Celtic: the merger of palatovelars into plain velars was straightforward and wasn't followed by any secondary, characteristically satem changes (cf. Germanic and RUKI). Centumisation is taken to have been a single, simple step:|-|Carite is peculiar in that it is possible to recover the identity of the palatovelar series before the labial <i>*w</i>, as they didn't coalesce into a labiovelar, and are instead preserved as <i>*kw *kʰw *gw *gʰw</i>. This is also present in Greek, which reflects initial <i>*ḱw</i> as κυ- (<i>ku-</i>, as in grc@κύων=kúōn 'dog', from pie@ḱwṓ; other palatovelars analogously), and (with varying peculiarities) internal <i>*Ḱw</i> as a geminate labiovelar instead of a short one (for example /-kk-/, as in Aeolian grc@ἴκκος=íkkos 'horse', from pie@h₁éḱwos) . ",,,,"Immediately following centumisation was <b>labiovelar dissimilation</b>, where many new Carite labiovelars, plenty of which were sourced from coalescent mergers, dissimilated at a distance. Namely, two consecutive syllables were disallowed to have labiovelars in their onsets, forcing a dissimilative loss of rounding:","It was roughly at this point that everyone can agree with the first merger of laryngeals, where <i>*h₁</i> merged with <i>*h₂</i>. It is assumed the direction of the merger was <i>*h₁ > *h₂</i> due to the colouring effect the merged laryngeal had on sonorants shortly thereafter. Some linguists prefer calling the laryngeals <i>*hₐ *hₒ</i> from this point onwards, referring to their colouring effects, but this usage is not adopted here.","At roughly the same time, the first loss of laryngeals occurred:",One of the changes that lead to the distinguishing of Carite from its now diverging cousins is the <b>vocalisation of sonorants</b> that worked in several stages. The first to be vocalised were sonorants next to a laryngeal:,,,,,,"Next, an epenthetic <i>schwa Indogermanicum</i> was inserted to take up the syllabicity of any remaining sonorant:",The same schwa was inserted after an interconsonantal laryngeal surrounded by true consonants:,"Due to the later diphthong reflexes of certain sequences of syllabic laryngeal and semivowel, and their lack of interaction with the preceding consonants, most caritologists also postulate a third schwa-insertion rule:|-|The length of diphthong in question (and, as a result, the position of the schwa relative to the laryngeal) are ultimately irretrievable due to Osthoff's law. The quality of the vowel in early Carite °PAWYOS° < pie@ph₂wyós shows the lack of interaction between the schwa and the first consonant (otherwise, <i>**pūjos</i> would have been expected).","This schwa took up rounding from any previous consonant, though <i>*w</i> curiously enough did not appear to take part in this process, possibly due to its semivocalic nature:",,"Due to the regressive action of the <i>boukolos</i> rule (Carite does not seem to reflect the progressive version of this law that well, or—according to some—at all), this delabialised any labiovelar after which it occured:",The schwa took colour from the previous laryngeal much like older <i>*e</i>:,,"The schwa also picked up rounding from a following <i>*m</i>, but not any other labial:|-|Notably, this rule postdates the colouring of post-laryngeal schwas as the coloured schwas did not become a high vowel, and instead merged with the older mid vowels.","Finally, it lost its distinctiveness by becoming a generic unrounded high vowel:","It is likely that at this point the laryngeals lost differentiation and merged into one general laryngeal continuant, completing the <b>second merger of laryngeals</b>:","The next loss of laryngeals (<b>second laryngeal loss</b>) happened to sequences of vowels with a laryngeal:|-|The lengthening of contracted laryngeal sequences still obeyed Osthoff's law, shortening the new vowels when followed by a resonant and then an obstruent. Examples of this process are scant, but evident in the so-called conjunctive nominals, which, in early Carite, take special forms in subordinated clauses and in coordinated clauses; a typical example of this is the masculine noun °EKWOS°, its genitive plural attested both as the regular <i>ekwōm</i> and in the conjunctive form <i>ekwomfe</i>; the length of the vowel in the suffix is indicative of Osthoff's law.",,"An unusual, but well-documented Carite change is the effect of laryngeals on consonants in word-initial position. They voiced obstruents and fortified semivowels, probably through a process of glottalisation:|-|A longstanding hypothesis is that the fortition of <i>*Hy</i> resulted in <i>*ḱ</i>, which was still unmerged, but otherwise invisible to historical linguistics. This opinion is somewhat controversial, but unfalsifiable due to our inability to elucidate which exact allophone <i>*y</i> fortited to. This change is occasionally termed <b>Engels' law</b>, and it was first posited by the Limburgish philologist Klaus Engels.",,,,,,,"After this, the laryngeals fail to effect any further changes, and are likely lost shortly thereafter, completing the third laryngeal loss:","Word-initial laryngeal voicing of <i>*s</i> enables the dating of another change, its word-initial debuccalisation:",This change was probably concurrent with the deaspiration of obstruents after nasals:,"Another concurrent change was the debuccalisation of word-initial prevocalic <i>*gʰ</i>:|-|It is probable that this change would also have affected word-initial <i>*gʷʰ</i> → <i>*ɦʷ</i>, but the labiovelarisation of its rounding probably reverted the change shortly thereafter, putting it at → <i>*gʷʰ</i> again.","The <b>collapse of the four-way contrast system</b> followed shortly thereafter. The aspiration feature of voiced aspirates would combine with their voicing to produce a breathy phonation, which merged with voiceless tenues. A possible glottalic interpretation is that in these early Carite stages voicing was a creaky or glottalised feature (explaining laryngeal voicing of word-initial obstruents), and that breathy segments had more in common acoustically with voiceless tenues. Regardless, the internal history of this change is opaque, and we only posit:|-|Notably, this change did not affect word-initial <i>*h</i> derived from older <i>*gʰ</i>, as it had already merged with the reflex of initial <i>*s</i>, but did affect all internal instances of <i>*gʰ</i>—even those that were preserved as a result of prefixation.",,,,Long-distance assimilation of labial <i>*p</i> into a following <i>*kʷ</i> likely happened around this time:,"It was roughly at this time that the more lenis labiovelar plosives <i>*kʷ *gʷ</i> lost their velar plosion, but retained the lower frequency timbre of velarisation by labiodentalising instead of merely shifting to labials:",,"When any vowel was followed by <i>*i *u</i>, the sequence collapsed into a diphthong with <i>*i *u</i> surfacing as the semivowels <i>*y *w</i>. If they were formerly stressed, the stress shifted to the preceding vowel.",,Certain homorganic vowel-sonorant sequences coalesced into trimoraic vowels:,,"The coalescence was the first part of a more prevalent collapse of certain homosyllabic diphthongs:|-|Notably, the collapse didn't affect sequences like <i>*yV</i>, nor the high vowels resulting from a laryngeal schwa. Osthoff's Law was clearly still productive at this stage, with e.g. pie@swéydoh₂ first becoming <i>*séydō</i> as the resulting <i>*ē</i> was shortened before predictably becoming °SWEYDOO°.",,,,,,,,,,,,"A few other consonant changes date to roughly this period, without an easy way to date them with precision relative to the rest of Carite developments of this time:",,,,,,,,,,"Somewhere around this time, the short high vowels *i *u underwent heavier modification:",,,,This was likely concurrent with this change pertaining to vowel length:,Stressed <i>*ē *ō</i> were raised in stressed syllables:,,Unstressed trimoraic vowels were reduced to their long counterparts:,!applyalways,!applyalways,"A surface filter of nasal assimilation that applied across Carite history is also dated to have started up to this point in time:|-|It is worth noting that <i>*m</i> did not appear to assimilate into <i>*n</i> before <i>*n</i>, which was retained as the sequence <i>*mn</i> instead.",,"The change that is taken to define Carite as a fully independent language in its own ecosystem is <b>Verner's Carite law</b>, a structural parallel of Verner's law in Germanic. Onsets of stressed, internal Carite syllables were voiced, and when the distinctive position of accent was lost to a word-initial accent relocation, the voicing phonemicised completely:|-|The voicing is likely to initially have affected only the onset of the stressed syllable that caused it, but voicing assimilation rules for clusters spread the voicing to the whole cluster.",LOANS,RESULT,MEANING,GRAMMAR,"Word-initial /w/, which only appeared before liquids or vowels, either fortited into /b/ or lenited into /h/, respectively:",,It is assumed that /s/ debuccalised word-finally when following a vowel at roughly the same time:,"Intervocalic semivowels appeared to geminate in specific environments, triggering Osthoff's law when relevant:|-|It is likely this change originally caused alterations due to vowels differing between suffixes.

While the association between hedgehogs and snakes appears to be common and a linguistic analysis of hedgehog as ""snake-eater"" checks out zoologically, an actual derivation only makes sense phonologically in Greek as its word for snake, grc@ἔχις=ékhis, would be the only pure reflex of a hypothetical pie@h₁éǵʰis, being displaced by pie@h₃égʷʰis in other branches.

More prevalent is the reconstruction with with an initial <i>*h₂-</i>. This laryngeal is reconstructed on the basis of the initial <i>ḫ-</i> in Hittite. §ed_celtic ascribes this to metathesis however, as neither Greek form shows any trace of the expected word-initial <i>α-</i>. While §ed_greek says the laryngeal might have been there originally, it must have vanished disappeared early in Greek history, possibly through dissimilation. The presence of the laryngeal would not affect the Carite outcome as Engels' law would require <i>*h₂w-</i> to be followed by a vowel.

While at a first glance, Carite is isolated in reforming the word as an i-stem, the global remodelling of root nouns as i-stem explains this phenomenon.

The majority seems to agree on <i>*Hnéh₃-</i> as a reconstruction - however, §oxf_intro, §sketch_albanian, §ed_celtic and §sketch_armenian reconstruct the root without a laryngeal and posit a single <i>*o</i> while §dic_gaulish simply reconstructs <i>*nom-</i>. The function of the second laryngeal appears to be to account for the discrepancy in terms of vowel length, as one may posit full grades and zero grades. One of the main arguments against the reconstruction of the second laryngeal appears to be the fact Tocharian retains a clear reflex of <i>*ē</i>. In order to account for this, §pie_to_pgmc reconstructs a third ablaut grade, being a lengthened e-grade, as this would prevent the laryngeal from colouring. §ed_greek suggests dissimilation of the second laryngeal to <i>*h₁</i> instead. Either way, the lack of vowel length in Carite is clear. As <i>**n̥h₃m-</i> would likely have resulted in <i>**nōm-</i>, one could ask if the version with laryngeal is problematic for Carite. However, it is possible the preceding laryngeal prevented the lengthening - after all, there are no other comparable cases with word-initial <i>*Hn̥HC</i>.",,Thu Aug 20 2020 16:25:50 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)

While the appurtenance of Greek and Sanskrit is very attractive, the Sanskrit form poses formal problems. For this reason, alternative etymologies are often posited, such as <i>*wor(hₓ)dʰwo-</i> for the Graeco-Aryan reflexes. However, there are no traces of a possible digamma in Mycenaean. If one would adhere to this theory, the only proof of <i>*h₃</i> would expire, leading to many to reconstruct <i>*h₂</i> instead, even though this is incompatible with the Carite reflex. <i>*h₁</i>, which is also sometimes reconstructed, is incompatible with the Germanic full grade. §ed_germanic posits an old compound of pie@h₃er- and pie@dʰeh₁-, although the loss of the second laryngeal would be puzzling. If the alternate etymology of Graeco-Aryan is applied to Carite, we would end up with an old <i>**urdwos</i> rather than <i>*ordwos</i>. However, considering the earliest attestation of this lexeme is a hapax legomenon, we may be dealing with a deviating form, and the merger of both options into <i>*urdwos</i> that followed makes it only more uncertain.
