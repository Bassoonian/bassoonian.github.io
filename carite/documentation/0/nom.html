<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<p>Much of early Carite nominal morphology closely followed the typical western Indo-European model. The declension of nouns and adjectives was closely linked together, and they shared most of their morphology. Degrees of comparison in adjectives have been morphologised for some time, but this comparative system also partook in the normal nominal inflection processes.</p>
<p>Carite nouns distinguished eight cases, the full western Indo-European set, as in Proto-Celtic, but reflected only two numbers, having lost the morphological dual and replacing it thoroughly with the inherited plural. Carite reflected all three genders cleanly at this point, and amplified the distinction between feminines and masculines through inter-paradigmatic analogy. All adjectives tended to reflect all three genders through change of suffix inflection class; the analogical component of gender agreement was much stronger in early Carite than in the roughly contemporaneous Old Latin or Ancient Greek, which still had adjectives that conflated some of the gender categories.</p>
<p>In inflection, Carite nouns also reflect the Indo-European accent system to some extent: nearly all declensional classes (that is, apart from acrostatics) have accent-sensitive declension, with alternative endings for nouns with an etymological oxytonic accent pattern. It's uncertain whether the accent really was still in such a position in early Carite, as the inscriptions are unmarked for stress, but it was certainly on its way out at that point.</p>
<p>In this chapter, the different declension classes in §lang_0 will be discussed first - however, some major innovations or issues common to paradigms will be discussed after in separate chapters. These include the plural suffixes of the genitive, as well as all the oblique plural suffixes. Likewise, the old Proto-Indo-European categories that did not survive will also be described separately.</p>
<h2>Thematic Nominals</h2>
<p>This category of nominals includes o-stems and a-stems and is widely referred to as the thematic set due to the naming conventions of the equivalents of these declension categories in Proto-Indo-European. Some caritologists refer to them as the second and first declension, respectively, after the names in Ancient Greek and Latin.</p>
<h3>O-stems</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The <b>radical masculine thematic</b> table on the right provides a good starting point for the o-stems. Most of its forms very cleanly continue the Indo-European masculine o-stem inflection: the top three singular forms continue the universally accepted suffixes <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="hovertext" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ος (-os), Latin -us, Proto-Germanic *-az, Armenian -∅"><i>*-os</i></span>, <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="hovertext" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ε (-e), Latin -e, Proto-Germanic *-∅"><i>*-e</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ον (-on), Latin -um, Proto-Germanic *-ą"><i>*-om</i></span>. The genitive singular appears to continue <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ου (-ou, < Proto-Greek *-oyyo), Old Latin -osio, Armenian -ոյ (-oy)"><i>*-osyo</i></span>, which is the pronominal equivalent of the <i>*-os</i> §oxf_intro§ reconstructs; the <i>-ī</i> that appears in Italo-Celtic is of unknown origin. The long vowels in the ablative and dative singular were presumably already present in Proto-Indo-European <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ō (< Old Latin -ōd)"><i>*-ōd</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ω(ι) (-ō(i)), Latin -ō, Proto-Germanic *-ai"><i>*-ōy</i></span> (where the long vowel is the result of an original <i>**o-e</i> contraction according to §oxf_intro§, §compgrammar§ and §pie_morph§) - §ed_germanic§'s ablative suffix, <i>*-ead</i>, is incompatible with the Carite reflex; §compgrammar§ posits <i>*-ōt</i> instead but remarks that Sabellic has <i>*-ōd</i>, supposedly from <i>**-oVt</i>. The similarity to pie@h₂éd (whence °AD°) is most likely not a coincidence. Additionally, he mentions that the original late form may have been <i>*-ā-</i>, with the substitution with <i>*-ō-</i> being a late analogical development shared with Latin. The same is presumably true for Carite - after all, <i>*-eh₂ed</i> would clearly have resulted in an a-vocalism after all. The locative and instrumental cases also faithfully reflect the Indo-European suffixes <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ī, Armenian -∅"><i>*-oy</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ō"><i>*-oh₁</i></span>, respectively. As pointed out by §compgrammar§, <i>*o</i> as thematic vowel for the locative contrasts with the <i>*e</i> found in consonant stems and must be a late development. The plural nominative form does not appear to continue the typical <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Irish -u, Proto-Germanic *-ôz, ?Armenian -ք (-kʿ)"><i>*-ōs</i></span> (again, from an original <i>**-oes</i>) but continues the pronominal suffix <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Irish -∅, Ancient Greek -οι (-oi), Latin -ī"><i>*-oy</i></span> of the same usage - this conflation took place in all branches except for Indo-Iranian and Germanic. It is worth noting that, like Old Irish, Carite retained the non-pronominal ending in the vocative plural. The accusative once again faithfully reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ονς (-ons), Latin -ōs, Proto-Germanic *-anz, Armenian -ս (-s)"><i>*-oms</i></span>. While irrelevant to Carite as Osthoff's Law would have neutralised it regardless, some Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic forms appear to require <i>*-ōns</i> with a long vowel; please refer to §accusativeplural§ for further reading.</p>
			<p>The <b>oxytonic masculine thematic</b> table, as expected, mostly mirrors its radical equivalent - the only discrepancies are caused by the stressed raising of Pre-§lang_0 <i>*ō</i>. More precisely, the deviating forms are the ablative, dative and instrumental singular as well as the vocative, genitive and instrumental plural forms.</p>

			<p>Most of what needs to be said about the <b>neuter thematic</b> tables - providing a neuter version of the o-stems - has been discussed above; after all, the oblique forms are identical, and we can see that the other three cases all share a suffix. In the singular, this is the same form as the accusative case as discussed above. In the plural, we find the reflex of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf.

			<p>The <b>radical feminine thematic</b> table on the left clearly shows that the vowel distribution was significantly simpler in a-stems than in o-stems. The nominative singular form has been discussed above as it is identical to the non-oblique neuter plural forms. Despite also departing from the same <i>*-eh₂</i>, the reflex of the vocative suffix is short rather than the expected long vowel. It appears that in the vocative suffix, the laryngeal was dropped after colouring but before the lengthening - alternatively, one may posit that word-final <i>*-VH</i> only underwent lengthening if the following word started with a consonant (as almost all do), and that the vocative nature separated it from the rest of the clause, thus preventing the lengthening from occurring. It is more than likely that this also happened in the other branches; however, in many cases, the vocative suffix was later made identical to the nominative suffix, undoing this distinction in length. It is not sure if §lang_0 also began this process of analogy - the metre of a specific inscription does in fact point towards a short vowel, however. The accusative in Carite may go back to both <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ην (-ēn), Latin -am, Proto-Germanic -ǭ"><i>*-eh₂m</i></span> or another form with the more regular syllabicisation <i>*-eh₂m̥</i> - the Greek forms require the former, however. This issue appears to be important enough for a reconstruction <i>*-ām</i> to exist (cf. §pie_to_pgmc§). The genitive cleanly reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ης (-ēs), arch. Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic -ōz"><i>*-eh₂(e)s</i></span> while the ablative with its word-final rhotic must reflect a pre-§lang_0 <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ā (< Old Latin -ād)"><i>*-eh₂d</i></span> rather than <i>*-eh₂s</i> - this is clearly a transfer from the o-stems. The dative regularly continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ηι (-ēi), Latin -ae, Proto-Germanic *-ôi"><i>*-eh₂ey</i></span> while the locative equally regularly reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf.

Proto-Germanic *-ō"><i>*-eh₂h₁</i></span> as the reflex of <i>*-eh₂eh₁</i> would be bisyllabic. Unlike the o-stems, a-stems retained their non-pronominal suffix in the nominative plural, continuing <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic -ôz"><i>*-eh₂es</i></span>. Like in the singular, the accusative plural is inconclusive about a possible syllabicisation of the nasal in <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ας (-ās), Latin -ās, Proto-Germanic *-ōz"><i>*-eh₂ms</i></span> - as in the singular, some reconstruct <i>*-āns</i> instead.</p>
			<p>Similar to the o-stems, the <b>oxytonic feminine thematic</b> table on the left is near identical to its radical equivalent. The deviating forms are locative singular, which underwent the raising of long, stressed mid vowels, and the genitive plural.</p>

<h3>Adjectives</h3>
<p>Thematic adjectives were likewise either radical or oxytonic and employed o-stem inflections for the masculine and neuter declensions and a-stem inflections for the feminine declensions. The actual suffixes appear to have been identical, as can be seen below:</p>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_UNSTRESSED_DEF||</br>||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_DEF||
<h2>Iotic Nominals</h2>
<p>The iotic category is made up of i-stem nouns and adjectives. Two things are noteworthy about the iotic nominals in Carite: the proliferation of the <i>*-ih₂</i> paradigm as functional feminine and the almost wholesale absorption of the u-stems and consonant stems. It is very likely these two processes not just happened at the roughly same time, but also reinforced each other: the Proto-Indo-European <i>*-ih₂- ~ *-yeh₂-</i> inflection - referred to as the <i>devī</i> inflection by §compgrammar§ - was a relatively productive class, forming feminine derivatives of (among others) the athematic stems. For example, for the present participle <i>*-ont-s</i>, we find a feminine in <i>*-ont-ih₂</i> and for u-stem adjectives on <i>*-u-s</i>, we find <i>*(e)w-ih₂</i>. The combination of <i>*-is</i> being identical for both masculine and feminine uses in Proto-Indo-European and early Carite's thorough remodelling based on noun gender may have contributed to <i>*-ih₂</i> winning over at least several forms of the feminine i-stems. Likewise, the usage of <i>*-ih₂</i> to form feminine forms of u-stems and consonant stems is likely to have reinforced their almost wholesale transfer to i-stems - the transfer of this adjectival usage to nouns was presumably aided by the substantival usage of feminine adjectives and had profound effects on the look of Carite - after all, all <i>*-tis</i> nouns, which were feminine, seem to be continued through Pre-§lang_0 <i>*-tih₂</i>. Some claim that the adoption of a feminine singular <i>*-ih₂</i> would also be aided by the identical neuter plural through analogy with the thematic set. Other languages such as Latin did not retain this class and extended them in nominals (cf. lat@genetrīx < <i>*-ih₂-k-s</i>).</p>
<h3>Nouns</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>As may be seen in the <b>radical masculine iotic</b> table on the right, the masculine i-stems combine retention and innovation. The nominative and accusative singular forms faithfully reflects the typical <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ις (-is), Latin -is, Proto-Germanic *-iz"><i>*-is</i></span> and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ιν (-in), Latin -em, Proto-Germanic *-į"><i>*-im</i></span>. The Carite vocative either continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ι (-i), ?Proto-Germanic *-i"><i>*-i</i></span> or, significantly less likely, a secondarily shortened full grade <i>*-ey</i>. The genitive likewise regularly continues <i>*-eys</i>, which is the full grade followed by the athematic genitive <i>*-s</i> ending - it is as such unable to continue the o-grade posited by §compgrammar§ continued in Proto-Germanic <i>*-aiz</i>. As we have seen before, the word-final rhotic in the ablative <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Old Latin -īd"><i>**-eyd</i></span> appears to be a contamination from the o-stems attached to the full grade while the dative is the regular unstressed reflex of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="hovertext" title="cf. Latin -ī"><i>*-eyey</i></span>. The locative does not appear to continue <i>*-ēy</i> (from <i>**-ey-i</i>) but continues the bare grade, <i>*-ey</i>, instead. Rather than the <i>*-eh₁</i> §compgrammar§ posits, the Carite instrumental presumably continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ī"><i>*-ih₁</i></span> instead with analogical vocalism as posited by §pie_to_pgmc§. In the plural forms, we once again find a regular reflex of unstressed <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin -ēs, Proto-Germanic *-īz"><i>*-eyes</i></span> for the nominative and vocative with the accusative being regularly represented by <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -εις (-eis), Latin -īs, Proto-Germanic *-inz"><i>*-ims</i></span>.</p>
			<p>In its oxytonic equivalent, we find several occurrences of historical raising of stressed long mid vowels. More precisely, we find differences in the dative singular as well as the nominative and vocative plural forms.</p>

			<p>As mentioned above, the Carite feminine i-stems continue a conflation of the i-stems, which were identical for masculine and feminine nouns, and the so-called <i>devī</i> inflection, i.e. the ablauting <i>*-ih₂- ~ *-yeh₂-</i> class. In the <b>radical feminine iotic</b> table on the left, we can see that the nominative singular did continue <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Proto-Germanic *-ī"><i>*-ih₂</i></span>. It is more than likely the vocative singular continues the same origin - the short vowel can be attributed to the vocative shortening, either occurring under the same circumstances it did for the a-stems or through analogy with them. The accusative continues <i>*-ih₂m</i> - for the possible syllabicisation of the nasal, please refer to the a-stems. The remaining singular forms are difficult to etymologise - after all, both <i>*-ey-</i>, which would be inherited from the i-stems, and <i>*-ih₂-</i>, which would continue the <i>devī</i> inflection, result in the same outcome. As such, one may only posit with absolute certainty that the oblique forms of the feminine i-stems in Carite perfectly mirrors those of the masculine i-stems. In the plural, we find a continuation of <i>*-ih₂s</i> for the nominative and vocative, while the accusative may either reflect <i>*-ih₂ms</i> - again, please consult the a-stem section regarding the nasal syllabicity - or be the inherited i-stem as can be seen in the masculine i-stem.</p>
			<p>As goes for the masculine i-stem declension in §lang_0, we may find a historical raising of the vowel in the dative singular in the <b>oxytonic feminine iotics</b>; this is the only difference between the radical and oxytonic paradigms.</p>

While we are unable to reconstruct any oxytonic neuter iotics nouns, there was almost surely a different set of endings; we may find this set in the i-stem adjectives. As above, this involves the historical raising of the stressed long mid vowel and like in the feminine paradigm, this only occurs in the dative singular form.</p>

||TABLE-ADJ_I_UNSTRESSED_DEF||</br>||TABLE-ADJ_I_STRESSED_DEF||
<h2>Nasal Nominals</h2>
<p>The nasal category is made up of the nouns that ended on <i>*-(m)ō</i> and <i>*-mn̥</i>. These nouns are either or masculine; no feminine derivation is attested - it is likely that any originally feminine n-stems, as they were called in Proto-Indo-European, were remodeled into another class. Several of the neuter collective forms were reanalysed into masculine nouns before the collective perished and gave way to plural forms that came into being through analogy. It is worth noting that these paradigms did not appear to participate in the radical/oxytonic split - while we can find traces of oxytonic stress through e.g. the effects of Verner's Law, it appears the suffixes only reflected a radical accentuation.</p>
<p>Worth noting is the consonant in the ablative, dative and locative plurals, reflecting the deaspiration of <i>*bʰ</i> following nasals, contrasting with the surfacing *-π- (<i>*-p-</i>) in other declensions.</p>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">In the masculine nasals, the nominative singular regularly continues <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ων (-ōn), Latin -ō, Proto-Germanic *-ô"><i>*-ō</i></span>, itself from <i>**-on-s</i>. Unlike Greek and like Latin, Carite did not restore the final nasal, while the vocative regularly provides a reflex of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf.

		<div class="col-8">Where the masculine declension appears to primarily be using an o-grade, its neuter equivalent appears to continue a zero grade instead. It is possible that this grade was generalised from the <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf.

The rest of the singular suffixes neatly correspond to those found in the masculine nasals but attached to an e-grade instead, e.g. <i>*-menos</i> in the genitive. In the nominative, vocative and accusative plural, the typical neuter plural suffix is without a doubt analogical.</div>

<h2>Acrostatic Nominals</h2>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The class of <b>acrostatic nominals</b> is a rather closed class and only contains a select handful of neuter nouns. It historically derives from the neuter s-stems. The singular nominative, vocative and accusative contained an endingless <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ος (-os), Latin -us"><i>*-os</i></span>, which may prehistorically have been a zero grade <i>*-s</i>, while the other forms consist of <i>*-es-</i> followed by the athematic suffixes.

As in the nasal nominals, the ablative is the black sheep, being the innovated <i>*-esōd</i>. The same applies to the plural - however, the original nominative/vocative/accusative plural <i>*-ōs</i> (from <i>**-os-h₂</i>) appears to have been phased out in favour of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -εα (-ea), Latin -era"><i>*-eseh₂</i></span> as in most daughters.</p>

		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-ESOS_UNSTRESSED_DEF||</div>
	</div>
</div>
<h2>Remodelled paradigms</h2>
<h3>U-stems</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the iotic nominals, u-stems, were entirely remodeled into i-stems for all three genders. For example, we find the remodeling in all three genders of the nouns with °LOKUS° reflecting pie@lókus, °NAVI° being the reflex of pie@néh₂us and °DORWI° being the expected remodeling of pie@dóru. Likewise, in adjectives, we find e.g. °DILVIS° for pie@délkus. There appears to be an important distinction in the remodeling of nouns and adjectives. While for nominals, the nominative grade appears to have been preserved, adjectives appeared to continue their hysterokinetic pattern: for example, the hysterokinetic variant of <i>*délkus</i> was <i>*dl̥kús</i>, which was remodeled as <i>*dl̥kwís</i>, regularly yielding €DILVIS€. We may find a noteworthily similar but far from identical parallel in Latin, which similarly remodeled u-stems into i-stems. However, this notably only affected adjectives with nouns remaining intact and also lacks the proliferation of <i>*-ih₂</i>, which instead entirely merged into <i>*-is</i>.</p>
<h3>Consonant stems</h3>
<p>Like u-stems, Carite consonant stems were almost entirely remade into i-stems. It is worth noting that Proto-Indo-European had many different types of consonant stems (with i-stems and u-stems technically behaving as if one, too). Consonant stems that did not belong to any of the categories below were remade into i-stems through the system explained above. For nouns, we once again find remodeling of all genders with e.g. °PODS° (< pie@pṓds), °NUFT° (< pie@nókʷts) and °EYE° (< pie@h₃ókʷs) reflecting masculine, feminine and neuter nouns, respectively. As opposed to u-stems, which generally had relatively predictable ablauting patterns, consonant stems were far more quirky in Proto-Indo-European with the hypercorrectional usage of Szemerényi's Law not making matters any clearer. As is the case for u-stems, Carite appears to have generalised the nominative grade, but notably doing so after undoing any "wrong" application Szemerényi's Law; this very often (but not always) happened to be the accusative grade as well. No strictly consonantal adjectives from Proto-Indo-European survive (if there were any at all); however, the present participle of verbs was in fact remodeled. As for the u-stems, we may draw a parallel to Latin adjectives (but not nouns).</p>
<h4>R-stems</h4>
<p>The kinship terms in <i>*-t(e)r-</i> appear to have been thematicised into <i>*-tros</i> and <i>*-treh₂</i> depending on noun gender; for example, for pie@ph₂tḗr and pie@méh₂tēr, we find °PATER° and °MATER° respectively, with the voiced dental in the word for "father" being an indication of the retention of suffixal stress through Verner's Law. Likewise but without the dental, we find °TAIKWER° for an original pie@dayh₂wḗr, with the zero grade making the preceding semivowel syllabic.</p>
<p>As a formal variation on the group above, we find the Proto-Indo-European suffixes <i>*-tōr</i> and <i>*-trih₂</i> - given the proliferation of i-stems as discussed above and with such obvious analogical opportunity, it should come at no surprise that the masculine suffix was reformed into <i>*-tris</i> in §lang_0.</p>
<p>In other words, often zero grades, we find a thematicised full grade. The word for star, °ASTER° (< pie@h₂stḗr), appears to reflect <i>*-ereh₂</i> while °STARLING° (< pie@spḗr) appears to continue <i>*-eros</i>. pie@h₂nḗr, on the other hand, appears to be continued in °NERO°, where the suffix also appears in a zero grade.</p>
<h4>R/N-stems</h4>
<p>In some Indo-European languages, we find a class of neuter nouns ending on <i>*-r</i> but with other cases being built off <i>*-n-</i>, hence the name. By late Proto-Indo-European times, this rather archaic and closed category was already well on its way out, being variously remodeled in different means, sometimes through different means for the same word in the same language. Carite appears to have primarily thematicised these by appending <i>*-om</i> to this original rhotic suffix - as such, we may find °PALMSOLE° for pie@dʰénr̥ and °SPRINGSEASON° for pie@wésr̥. On the other hand, we find e.g. °BLOOD° continuing a derivation through the oblique suffix with the nasal (besides its more expected reflex °SANIES°).</p>
<h4>N-stems</h4>
<p>As discussed above, only two categories of n-stems appear to have survived into Carite. Masculine <i>*-ō</i>, arguably one of the most widespread n-stem formations survived (with its feminine equivalent having been iotacised); its far less widespread e-grade equivalent, <i>*-ēn</i>, appears to have been remodeled inconsistently, with °UKSEN° showing remodeling as <i>*-ō</i> but °BRANI° showing remodeling as <i>*-nis</i> - °VENA° (< pie@gʷḗn) curiously enough was thematicised as <i>*-eneh₂</i> rather than as an i-stem as one might expect.</p>
<h4>M-stems</h4>
<p>Proto-Indo-European appears to have possessed a handful of m-stems, all feminine. Once again, it comes to no surprise that these were reformed as feminine iotics in §lang_0: °EARTH° continues pie@dʰéǵʰōm (with <i>*-mih₂</i> for <i>*-ōm</i>) while °WINTER° continues pie@ǵʰéyōm (with the vocalism being the result of Schwebeablaut?).</p>
<h4>S-stems</h4>
<p>As we have seen before, neuter s-stems are regularly continued in the acrostatic class. The few surviving masculine and feminine nouns, which were significantly less widespread, underwent thematicisation as <i>*-osos</i> and <i>*-oseh₂</i> according to grammatical gender. In adjectival fashion, however, the paradigm survived in the comparative degree (see below).</p>
<h2>Genitive plural suffix</h2>
<p>Curiously enough, the genitive plural suffix appears to be *-ο̄μ ~ *-ῡμ (<i>*-ōm ~ *-ūm</i>) across the board, being attached directly to the stem. This is problematic for two reasons, one being the length, the other being the lack of an expected vowel and/or consonant for a-stems and i-stems.</p>
<p>For the <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ων (-ōn), Latin -[ōr]um, Proto-Germanic *-ǫ̂">vowel followed by the nasal</span>, §compgrammar§ posits <i>*-om</i> (with o-stems reflecting <i>*-ōm</i>), which would require the long vowel in Carite to be the result from analogy with the o-stems. While this would not be an isolated case (the presence of <i>*-d</i> in the ablative was also originally exclusive to o-stems but was generalised across the board - for an identical development, refer to Sabellic), it is most certainly not the most attractive answer. It is worth noting, however, that Indo-Iranian, Lithuanian and Greek also only retain a long vowel, which may potentially hint at an common (and possibly areal) development. §oxf_intro§ simply posits <i>*-om</i>, also for o-stems, without further discussion, and may as such safely be discarded - attempting to explain the length through an original <i>*-o-em</i> would be baseless here. §ed_germanic§ posits <i>*-ohₓom</i> instead (with an additional <i>*-o-</i> for o-stems) which is the only explanation for the overlong vowel in the Germanic reflex (§compgrammar§ refers to the Germanic reflex as an enigma). As in the other languages, the loss of this intervocalic laryngeal which put two vowels in hiatus had two identical vowels collapse into a single long vowel. While this explanation suits the uniformly bimoric nature of the Carite suffix better, it is unclear what exactly the original Pre-§lang_0 form was. §pie_morph§ posits <i>*-ohₓom</i> (where the unknown laryngeal may be <i>*h₁</i> or <i>*h₃</i>) for thematic inflections - and thus lacking the extra vowel that §ed_germanic§ posited - while §oxf_intro§'s <i>*-om</i> is reconstructed for athematic inflections. If we posit that the thematic ending spread to all athematic paradigms, we may adopt this reconstruction for Carite as well, despite all the uncertainties. In the end, we can only ascertain that the Carite reflex was uniformly long.</p>
<p>It is likely that whichever suffix was at the core of the Carite reflex was originally appended to the stem in late Proto-Indo-European - that is, attached to <i>*-eh₂-</i> for a-stems, <i>*-y- ~ *-i-</i> for i-stems and <i>*-w- ~ *-u-</i> for u-stems. While the last category is ultimately irrelevant in Carite, it noteworthy that Carite does not appear to continue any of these. For the a-stems, we would expect a <i>**-aōm</i> sequence, while for the i-stems the high vowel or its semivowel equivalent would have been retained. More importantly, as this <i>**-a-</i> or, when syllabic, <i>**-i-</i> would have been stressed in oxytonic declensions, the raising of the genitive plural suffix would not have occurred. This either points towards the loss of these vowels/consonants before the raising or to the adoption of the raising in oxytonic inflections after it occurred, which would presumably be very late in §lang_0 history. While both scenarios are possible, the loss of these vowels is often explained as follows: for the i-stems, the oxytonic variant was generalised for the genitive plural rather early, which would leave us with <i>**-iōm</i> rather than <i>**-yōm</i>. A contraction of <i>**-aōm</i> and <i>**-iōm</i> would be irregular and exclusive to this suffix, but it would solve this rather problematic case. Some prefer to explain the lack of <i>*-y- ~ *-i-</i> by analogy with the consonant stems (which were remodeled to become i-stems), which is about equally likely. It is worth noting that slightly distorting the genitive plural suffixes is a feature common to many Indo-European languages - as per §compgrammar§, some remodelings such as the adoption of a pronominal suffix in Italic is clear, for some such as Indo-Iranian, the correct explanation is in doubt and for others, it is entirely unclear - §compgrammar§ brings up Germanic as an example here, which was conveniently explained by §pie_to_pgmc§ as elaborated on above.</p>
<h2>Oblique plural suffixes</h2>
<p>In the plural, §lang_0 has -πος (<i>*-pos</i>) and -πις (<i>*-pis</i>) for ablative/dative and locative, respectively. These endings were presumably directly attached to the stem in Proto-Indo-European as we find reflexes of <i>*-o-</i> and <i>*-eh₂-</i> preceding it in the thematic inflections and reflexes of <i>*-i(h₂)-</i> in the iotic inflections. In the nasal nominals, we find -β- (<i>*-b-</i>) instead, which is the regular outcome of <i>*bʰ</i> when following nasals. As this does not line up very cleanly with the suffixes that are usually reconstructed, there are two aspects that need to be discussed: the origin of the labial plosive and the suffixes that follow it.</p>
<p>It is perhaps the most interesting approach to have a look at the reconstructions posited and to compare to other languages. §compgrammar§, for example, reconstructs both <i>*-bʰos</i> and <i>*-mos</i> for dative/ablative, which was directly appended to the stem, and <i>*-su</i> for the locative, likewise directly appended to the stem (although o-stems appear to continue a pronominal <i>*-oysu</i> instead). The <i>*-bʰ- ~ *-m-</i> is irrelevant to Carite, as the plosive variation was generalised in all daughters except Balto-Germanic, which almost exclusively continue the nasal - besides, it is likely there is no historical connection between the two sets of endings. After all, §jasanoffinstrumentalplural§ considers the labial element secondary, resulting from appending the original endings to an adverbial form. Greek appears to continue <i>*-si</i> instead in the locative, with the <i>*-i</i> being adopted from the singular suffix. The suffixes posited by §oxf_intro§ are very clearly wrong (for example, <i>*-bʰ-</i> and <i>*-m</i> are posited side by side as contrasting forms) and may be safely discarded. §pie_to_pgmc§ posits <i>*-mos</i> for dative/ablative, which is enough for Germanic but does not explain <i>*-bʰ-</i> elsewhere, and likewise posits <i>*-su</i> for the locative.</p>
<p>When departing from §compgrammar§'s reconstruction, the ablative/dative suffix is very straightforward. It is most likely that any reconstructional problems to do with these forms rather have to do with neither Greek nor Latin continuing these suffixes, rather importing the instrumental plural suffix <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -οις (-ois), Latin -īs (< Old Latin -eis)"><i>-*ōys</i></span> in o-stems (with analogical developments for a-stems). When approached from a non-Graeco-Roman point of view, the presence of the labial in the thematic proves itself to be a retention rather than innovation. As such, this suffix is essentially unproblematic.</p>
<p>The locative suffix, on the other hand is significantly more problematic. It is extremely attractive to derive it from the non-o-stem instrumental plural suffix <i>*-bʰis</i>, but this very obviously poses a major problem - while the notion of an instrumental plural becoming a locative also occurred in Latin and Greek, it was in all likelihood a matter of formal similarity after sound changes given the nearly complete lack of functional tangency. An alternative explanation involves departing from the <i>*-si</i> shared with Greek, followed by metathesis into <i>**-is</i> and subsequent adoption of the labial from the ablative/dative into <i>*-bʰis</i>, but this is even more problematic. It is perhaps more likely that we should in fact depart from the o-stem <i>*-ōys</i> (which, according to §jasanoffinstrumentalplural§, derives from <i>**oy-is</i>, where the first element is clearly pronominal in origin), which would be regularly shortened through Osthoff's Law. If this would be reanalysed as <i>**-o-ys</i>, it is not too hard to see the latter element <i>*-ys</i> achieving a standalone function - attaching it to the labial from the ablative/dative suffix would in fact yield <i>*-bʰis</i>. This is quite possibly the most likely course of history, as much as the exact development remains a mystery.</p>
<p>The only form that has not been discussed so far is the locative plural. While it appears to be exclusive to Carite, we may posit a feasible history leading to these forms. As confirmed by §compgrammar§, the instrumental suffix was originally a plain <i>*-bʰi</i>, to which the <i>*-s</i> was appended as a plural marker, yielding <i>*-bʰis</i>. It is extremely likely that we find the same plural marker <i>*-s</i> in the Carite instrumental plural forms - after all, all Carite instrumental plurals appear to be very transparently derived from their singular equivalents. It is likely that this Carite-exclusive innovation occurred after the development of the locative plural marker, possibly to disambiguate.</p>
<p>For further reading, on these particular discrepancies, please consult §jasanoffinstrumentalplural§.</p>
<h2>Degrees of comparison</h2>
<h3>Comparatives</h3>
||TABLE-COMPARATIVE||
<p>Carite comparatives appear to continue pie@-yōs, originally an intensive marker that evolved into a comparative in many other daughter languages. In Proto-Indo-European, the root was directly appended to the root rather than the stem - while we have no early attestations, §lang_0 most likely generalised the "new" stem - that is, the stem as considered to be the stem in §lang_0, which does not include <i>*i</i> for the i-stems, but does include <i>*w</i> of old u-stem adjectives. Besides this, it did appear to include aspects such as <i>*-n-os</i>, which post-consonantally ejected a vowel per the the original sound changes - that is, <i>*m</i> always became <i>*um</i> while the other sonorants ejected <i>*i</i> unless preceded by a labial consonant that is not <i>*w</i>. The labiodentals <i>*f *v</i>, stemming from Proto-Indo-European <i>*kʷ *gʷ</i>, would have been regularly delabialised, but are retained as their fricative results in this synchronic approach. Also important is the historic change of <i>*ty *dy</i> into <i>*s *z</i> which was morphologised.</p>
<p>The comparative inflection is interesting as it is the only Carite inflection in which the masculine and feminine gender has the same suffixes. The Indo-Iranian devī-inflection for feminine forms is proven to be an innovation by §compgrammar§ and is not present in Carite. The neuter forms very cleanly continue those of the acrostatic nominals discussed before, while the masculine and feminine suffixes are incredibly similar and contain the athematic suffixes we have discussed above. The appurtenance of <i>*-yes-</i> in Proto-Indo-European is highly uncertain, but it is very likely that nominal influence has affected the ablaut pattern here and the Carite full grade is secondary.</p>
<h3>Superlatives</h3>
||TABLE-SUPERLATIVE||
<p>One of the biggest mysteries about Carite morphology is the fact its superlative appears to continue pie@-ism̥os (variously reconstructed as pie@-ism̥mos). This is widely considered to be an Italo-Celtic development and its appurtenance in Carite is often cited as an argument against a distinct Italo-Celtic clade. Either way, the superlatives are morphologically less complicated than the comparatives as their suffix is easier to append to stems.</p>
<h2>Numerals</h2>
<h3>Cardinals</h3>
<p>As in Proto-Indo-European, the numerals for one, two and three are inflected for gender and case while the numeral for four has generalised the nominative neuter form and become uninflected like the numbers that follow it.</p>
<div class="container">

		<div class="col-4">
			<p>As the inflections of the numerals one and three are regular, we may briefly visit them first and have a more in-depth look at two after. The inflection of °1° on the left follows the standard radical inflection pattern of the thematic nominals with the obvious exception that plural forms do not exist. Likewise, °3° faithfully follows the oxytonic plural inflection of the iotic nominals, with the distinct feminine stem having been discarded. It is worth noting that these did not agree in number - when referring to a noun in the plural but with a singular meaning, the numeral for one strictly continues the paradigm presented here and does not employ the plural suffixes we find in the radical thematic paradigm.</p>

		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-NUM_THREE||</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-NUM_TWO||</div>
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The quirky inflection of the later reflexes of °2° may be explained rather cleanly by proposing a archaic retention of the dual inflection, which was lost in the rest of §lang_0. However, this is not universally accepted as the Proto-Indo-European numeral is sometimes reconstructed as indeclinable, which would make the proliferation of the dual inflection in this numeral rather unlikely as it would coincide with the decline and eventual loss in all other cases for nominals and verbs alike - unless §lang_0 did in fact retain dual forms which did not happen to be attested anywhere. Nonetheless, many reflexes are almost too transparently dual at their core that any other explanation would require a significantly better argumentation.</p>
			<p>More concretely, °2° appears to have been inflected as a thematic adjective. The syncretism between nominative, vocative and accusative is a transparently dual feature. The monosyllabic nature of this numeral is confirmed by the raising of the suffixal mid vowels, which only occurs when stressed. <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek -ω (-ō)"><i>*-oh₁</i></span> and <i>*-oy(h₁)</i> appear to be continued in the first half of the paradigm for masculine and neuter respectively, while the feminine form presumably continues <i>*-eh₂i</i>, which probably came into being by analogy with the masculine o-stem. If there was a final laryngeal here, as reconstructed by §pie_to_pgmc§ as <i>*dwéh₂ih₁</i>, it would have to be lost early enough for the lengthening not to occur. The remaining suffixes appear to have been lifted directly from the plural number, which may possible indicate that the dual was already well on its way out when this numeral started inflecting.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<p>The numeral for four, °4°, continues a fossilisation of pie@kʷetwṓr, the neuter plural of pie@kʷetwóres, and is indeclinable. The lack of a <i>*w</i> reflex is notable and presumably involves dissimilation with the opening labiovelar. The other numbers up to and including ten continue the typical Proto-Indo-European set: °5° for five, °6° for six, °7° for seven, °8° for eight, °9° for nine and °10° for ten.</p>
<p>In most other Indo-European languages, we find a number followed by the numeral for ten (Germanic eleven and twelve are exceptions here) for numbers 11 to 19, and Carite is no different with the exception we find clearly fossilised forms for eleven and twelve. °11°, the §lang_0 word eleven, notably continues a compound of the more archaic numeral for one, pie@sḗm, rather than °1° which continues the newer pie@h₁óynos. The first element in °12° is clearly related to °2° and appears to continue <i>*dwo-</i>, which is the original of €2€ with the dual marker removed. In °13°, the long vowel can be explained by positing the bare stem <i>*trey-</i> or alternatively by departing from the combining form <i>*tri-</i> with the length arising through analogy with the numeral for thirty °30° (see below for more). The first component of °14° is the reflex of the combining form <i>*kʷétwr̥-</i> - albeit with the loss of the second labial element - without a doubt. The other numerals up to nineteen are significantly more transparent: °15°, °18° and °19° very clearly show both elements of the compound, while °16° involves regular voicing assimilation and °17° showcases the nasal filter.</p>
<p>Decads once again consist of an element combined with an old inflectional form of €10€. However, as in other languages, we find glottalisation affecting the initial dental, which surfaces as <i>*h₁</i>. °20° continues an old dual of ten, <i>*-dḱm̥tih₁</i>, alongside the combining <i>*dwi-</i> - it is notable that both voiced dentals underwent glottalisation here (compare e.g. lat@vīgintī). The other decads continue <i>*-dḱomt(h₂)</i>, where the appurtenance of the final laryngeal may not be ascertained in Carite. °30° is rather straightforwardly the combining <i>*tri-</i> alongside this decad marker. Besides lengthening preceding vowels, the <i>*h₁</i> from the original <i>*-dḱ-</i> cluster also surfaces as an a-coloured vowel in other contexts. As such, as a reflex of Pre-§lang_0 <i>*kʷétr̥-</i> (see above) and the decad marker, we find °40°. In the other decads, the marker is simply appended to the numeral: we find °50° from €5€, °60° from €6€, °70° from €7€ (with the loss of the labial nasal through analogy with the next decad), °80° from €8€ and °90° from €9€. The reflex of pie@ḱm̥tóm, °100° (with voiced initial stop due to Engels' Law), may or may not have referred to one hundred rather than any large amount back in §lang_0 times. No word for thousand may be reconstructed.</p>
<h3>Ordinals</h3>
<p>Suppletion for the ordinals for one and two is particularly common for Indo-European languages, and Carite is once again no different. Meaning "first", we find a formation based on pie@pró just like in every branch, yielding °1o°. The second ordinal, clearly formally identical to lat@alter, is °2o°. The other ordinals are more straightforwardly derived from the cardinals but require some extra prose nonetheless. The ordinal for three was originally presumably either pie@triyos or pie@tritos - like Slavic, Latin and Sanskrit (also Germanic but with a different suffix), the Carite reflex °3o° continues a conflation of the two forms, reconstructed with either <i>*-tyos</i> or <i>*-tiHos</i>; both are possible in Carite. The ancient ordinal for four, pie@kʷturyós, was like its close sisters replaced by <i>*kʷét(w)r̥tos</i> (with loss of the labial per above), yielding °4o°. While we regularly find <i>*-tós</i>, both as participle suffix and seemingly as ordinal marker due to original zero grades, it is likely that the restoration of the full grades in Carite was accompanied by a stress shift as we fail to see the effects of Verner's Law; this goes for all following ordinals too. For example, the old ordinal for five, pie@pn̥kʷtós, was inherited as its reformed variant <i>*pénkʷtos</i> yielding °5o°. Likewise, the old ordinal for six, pie@uḱtós, was later reformed as <i>*swéḱstos</i> with restoration of the intermediate <i>*-s-</i> through analogy with the cardinal, yielding °6o°. The ordinal for seven appears to lack this dental suffix and simply has <i>*-ós</i> attached to the raw cardinal, yielding °7o° - it is thought its radical inflection is through analogy with the other ordinals. °8o° came into being through a suffix <i>*-wós</i> - though once again with radical inflection - although modern reconstructions often reconstruct the <i>*-w-</i> as being part of the cardinal, which would mean it was lost irregularly in Carite. For "ninth", we once again find the dental suffix, which was presumably not original but also appears in Greek, Balto-Slavic, Germanic etc. and yields °9o°. Finally, for the numeral ten, we find the dental suffix again and with reasonable proof that in Proto-Indo-European times, it was originally part of the stem before being reanalysed as ordinal marker; it yields °10o°. As the second element of 11 to 19, it similarly forms ordinals for them. We are unable to reconstruct an ordinal for any of the other decads but it is likely they too employed a dental suffix.</p>
<h2>Pronouns</h2>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<h4>First and second</h4>
<p>Carite pronouns are somewhat innovative when viewed in a European context: it shares with the Celtic language family a levelling of the pronominal nominative according to the oblique stem across all personal pronouns for the first and second persons. Most forms distinguish between a stressed an an unstressed form, where the unstressed forms continue the Proto-Indo-European clitics. The default usage of pronouns is unstressed, where independent stressed pronouns are disjunctive and empathic. Additionally, monosyllabic propositions require accented pronouns whereas polysyllabic ones require unaccented ones. Further choice is pragmatic.</p>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>For the <b>first person pronouns</b>, we find a nominative singular form which very clearly shows the onset of the oblique form, but is rather opaque otherwise. If we assume the addition of a nominative marker <i>*-s</i>, we may assume the application of Szemerényi's Law and depart from <i>*meN-</i> (which would have had its long vowel raised regularly). The nasal presumably was originally <i>*m</i> and either dissimilated from the preceding onset or assimilated to the nominative marker before it disappeared; the former is far more likely. The presence of the double nasal probably points towards a stem imported from the old genitive <i>*méme</i>. No atonic equivalent exists - after all, if the subject, were not to be stressed, it would simply be dropped. Evidently, a vocative first person marker does not exist either. For the accusative, we find a single form originating from <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek με (me)"><i>*mé ~ *me</i></span> (where the former continues a <i>**m-mé</i>), which had identical reflexes in §lang_0 (although they would drift apart again later). The old genitive mentioned underwent changes in all but Indic and Carite is no different - we find an added <i>*-s</i> genitival marker. A similar innovation happened in Doric and Italic, which took it one step further and turned it into regularly inflecting adjectives (cf. grc@ἐμέος=eméos and lat@meus). On top of this, as in the aforementioned Graeco-Italic forms, the medial labial surfaces as if <i>*w</i>, which is dissimilation with the inital labial and/or influence from the second person pronoun. The atonic form, which transparently reflects <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek ἐμοί (emoí)"><i>*moy</i></span>, was presumably not originally genitival and is presumably adopted from the dative. In the ablative, we find similar forms for tonic and atonic, where the atonic clearly represents a form which did not undergo the raising of stressed syllables. It consists of the usual <i>*me-</i> followed by the rhotic from the nominals, with the vowel likewisely being lengthened analogically. In the dative, we find the original tonic suffix <i>*-bʰi</i> altered in two ways: as in Italic and Balto-Slavic, the vowel was altered into <i>*-ey</i> to look more like a dative form, and the labial dissimilated into <i>*-ǵʰ-</i> as in Italic (cf. lat@mihi) and Indic. The atonic is identical to the genitive (which it may be the source of) as discussed above. The locative most likely <i>*méy</i>, which would be the stem <i>*mé-</i> with the athematic locative marker <i>*-i</i>; its identical atonic equivalent most likely continues an unstressed version of this. Finally, the typical alteration between tonic and atonic most likely points towards an original <i>*-ē</i>, which is in all likelihood the stem plus the instrumental marker <i>*h₁</i>.</p>
			<p>The plural stem <i>*n̥s-</i> most likely originally contained <i>*m</i> as in the singular forms, but the assimilation into <i>*n</i> to what is presumably a plural marker must have occurred early as the vowel colouring results into <i>*i</i> rather than <i>*u</i>. In the nominative, we find a reflex of <i>*n̥sés</i>, which is this plural stem with added athematic nominative plural suffix - this is distinct from the Greek innovation, which attached <i>*-s</i> to the accusative. In the accusative, we find forms parallel to the singular with a continuation of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek ἄμμε (ámme)"><i>*n̥smé</i></span> for the tonic and <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Latin nōs"><i>*nōs</i></span> for the atonic. The genitive, as in grc@ἀμμέων=amméōn, appears to add the typical plural suffix to the accusative, although it appears to use a zero grade <i>*-m</i> of the accusative here. The atonic variant is identical to the accusative. In the rest of the plural forms, we find the familiar plural suffix attached to <i>*n̥sm-</i> (with, as in the nasal nominals, the deaspiration of <i>*bʰ</i>) with the same <i>*nōs</i> reflex for all atonics; the voicing of the <i>*s</i> through Verner's Law is quite possibly analogical in nature.</p>

			<p>The <b>second person pronouns</b> are largely parallel to the first person pronouns. In the singular, we find a nominative matching late Proto-Indo-European <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek σύ (sú), Latin tū"><i>*tū</i></span> (which §pie_to_pgmc§ reconstructs as <i>*tuh₂</i>) instead. We find a short vowel in the vocative, which is reminiscent of the a-stems and female i-stems and may in fact point towards an original laryngeal. As for the first person pronouns, no atonic variant exists for the nominative, while the vocative is by definition stressed and thus also lacks an atonic equivalent. In the accusative, we find the regular reflex of <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek σέ (sé)"><i>*twé</i></span> as tonic form while the full grade of the bare stem <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf.

In the genitive, we once again find the extension with genitival <i>*-s</i> in the tonic form <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek τέος (téos), Latin teus"><i>*téwes</i></span> and a presumably originally dative atonic <span class="hovertext" data-toggle="tooltip" title="cf. Ancient Greek σοί (soí)"><i>*toy</i></span>. The ablatives are entirely parallel to the first person pronouns, as are the datives (with the exception of the dissimilation of the labial), locatives and instrumentals. Though the reflexes are more distinct, the plural is entirely parallel to the first person pronoun, with the exception that <i>*n̥ ~ *n</i> is <i>*u ~ *w</i> and the vocative is the same as the nominative.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<h4>Third</h4>
||TABLE-PRON_PERS_3||
<p>The main third person pronouns are related to pclt@es and lat@is. Originally functioning as a weakly deictic "that" but later gaining a more anaphoric function, the nominative forms were relatively rare as dropping pronouns in these contexts was a common occurrence while the others functioned as the third person pronouns in most cases. This suppletive paradigm may seem daunting at first but once the suppletion system is identified, it is far more tame and shares much more with the nominals than one would notice at first sight. The stem split between nominative/accusative and the oblique forms is easy to identify - in fact, the nominative and accusative forms are identical to the suffixes of the oxytonic iotic adjectives (with the exception of the neuter singular, which shows pronominal *ρ (<i>*r</i>), on which will be elaborated below) - while the alterations within the oblique cases is considerable less transparent.</p>
<p>The masculine and neuter oblique forms are by far the easiest to start with. In the singular genitive, we find the reflex of <i>*e-syo</i>, where the latter element forms the second half of the o-stem genitive, while we find athematic suffixes to a <i>*esm-</i> stem; the only exception here is the ablative, which seems to use the o-stem ablative singular suffix. In the plural oblique cases, we find a stem <i>*ey-</i> which appears to have been extended with an additional <i>*s</i> prevocalically; the suffixes are all very familiar.</p>
<p>In the feminine oblique forms, we find <i>*esyeh₂s</i> in the genitive, while we find the usual a-stem endings to the <i>*esm-</i> stem. It is likely the introduction of this stem into the feminine paradigm is relatively late as this does not match up with §compgrammar§'s reconstructions, nor does it match up with its cognate forms in Latin. In the plural, we find the stem <i>*eys-</i>, of which the origin is disputed. Two valid proposals have been put forward which can co-exist. One is that the usual feminine stem, <i>*esy-</i>, was remodeled into <i>*eys-</i> through analogy with the stem we find in the masculine and neuter plural forms; the other is that it was outright replaced by it. The extension with the fricative is not particularly noteworthy as the typical feminine suffixes starting with <i>*-eh₂-</i> would have caused the prevocalic extension regardless.</p>
<p>In Latin, the feminine nominative and accusative plural forms were remade as <i>*ih₂-eh₂(e)s</i> and <i>*ih₂-eh₂ms</i>, respectively, while the original neuter plural was extended with the thematic ending in both Latin and Gothic. It is noteworthy Carite does not appear to reflect either innovation, though this is not at all surprising: after all, all four forms mentioned here were likewise inherited regularly in the i-stems.</p>
<h3>Relative & Interrogative</h3>
||TABLE-KWOS||
<p>The Carite relative and interrogative pronouns curiously appear to come from <i>*kʷós</i> rather than the more common <i>*kʷís</i> we find in other branches. Essentially a single paradigm, the inception of conjunctive nominals may have caused <i>*kʷós</i> to overtake its originally more common sibling, with the primary forms being interrogative and the conjunctive forms being relative.</p>
<p>°KWOSWHO° primarily declines like an oxytonic thematic; however, several forms stand out. Most notable is the pronominal *ρ (<i>*r</i>) of the neuter singular nominative and accusative we previously saw in the third person pronoun. The singular genitive forms are identical for all genders, ignoring the distinct form the feminine thematics have. Finally, the dative singular forms are also deviant from the usual thematic paradigm. These three differences were already present at a Proto-Indo-European level and are key characteristics of pronominal inflection and we will find them in other pronominal inflections too.</p>
<h3>Demonstrative</h3>
||TABLE-DEMPRON||
<p>The sole demonstrative pronoun we may reconstruct is °KEHENOS°. It is not of particular importance in §lang_0 times, but will take on a far more major role in the future. We find the same three characteristics - the neuter rhotic and the dative and genitive singular forms - as the relative and interrogative pronouns, but in a radical context.</p>
