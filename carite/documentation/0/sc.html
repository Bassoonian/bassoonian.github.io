<p>Several of Carite historical processes are firmly dateable to the Common Indo-European period. Thus, their internal history is generally impossible to investigate further. This page lists the reconstructable changes from Proto-Indo-European to Â§lang_0 in roughly chronological order and compares the phonological developments with its closest neighbours - Celtic, Greek, Latin and Germanic - as well as Armenian. Note that the sources of cognates put forward as reference are not included in this article's bibliography - please consult the dictionary entry of the Carite word for more information.</p>
