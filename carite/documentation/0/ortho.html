<h1>Orthography</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>§lang_0 is largely reconstructed in nature - only sporadic attestations exist. However, the attestations are numerous enough for us to be able to tentatively reconstruct the native alphabet that was used, which appears to be an offshoot of the Greek alphabet. While one may assume at first that due to its rather western location, we may find various features of western Greek that were also the source of the Old Italic script - however, this is not the case. Southern France was colonised by Ionians, which belonged to §kirchhoff§'s dark blue zone, as oppossed to most of the Italian peninsula, which belonged to the red zone. As such, despite being rather far from Greece geographically, readers not well acquainted with the archaic Greek alphabets will find the §lang_0 alphabet relatively easy to follow.</p>
<h2>Modernisation notes</h2>
<p>Please note that the alphabet as displayed below and employed in the lexicon is a modernised variant due to unicode limitations. By rendering the archaic letters with the modernised alphabet, including a distinction between upper- and lowercase, ease of use is greatly improved at the cost of historical accuracy. <!-- One may turn on the rendering of §lang_0 in archaic glyphs in the settings.-->Many Caritologists employ macrons in their modernisations to indicate length when not obvious from the orthography with a subset of those employing breves to mark semivowels due to their phonemic contrast with their syllabic equivalents.</p>
<h2>Consonants</h2>
<p>Nasals and plosives were written as in all Greek dialects - this means that /m n/ were notated as <img class='img_src_inline' title='μ' alt='μ' src='alphabetsvg/M.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='ν' alt='ν' src='alphabetsvg/N.svg'> <<μ ν>> and /p b t d k ɡ/ were notated as <img class='img_src_inline' title='π' alt='π' src='alphabetsvg/P.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='β' alt='β' src='alphabetsvg/B.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='τ' alt='τ' src='alphabetsvg/T.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='δ' alt='δ' src='alphabetsvg/D.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='κ' alt='κ' src='alphabetsvg/K.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='γ' alt='γ' src='alphabetsvg/G.svg'> <<π β τ δ κ γ>>. [ŋ], the prevelar allophone of /n/, was unsurprisingly written as <img class='img_src_inline' title='γ' alt='γ' src='alphabetsvg/G.svg'> <<γ>>.</p>
<p>With §lang_0 having a significantly larger (phonemic) fricative inventory than Ancient Greek, some unusualities are expected. The voiceless sibilant, /s/ was notated with <img class='img_src_inline' title='σ' alt='σ' src='alphabetsvg/S.svg'> <<σ>> - <<ς>>, the word-final alternative in the modernised rendering, had no archaic equivalent. Its voiced counterpart, /z/, appears to have been conveyed using <img class='img_src_inline' title='ζ' alt='ζ' src='alphabetsvg/Z.svg'> <<ζ>>. It is worth noting that this specific graph stands out for two reasons. In several transcriptions, no orthographic voicing distinction appears to be made for the sibilants. In the majority of the cases, however, the distinction is made, and one could argue that <img class='img_src_inline' title='ζ' alt='ζ' src='alphabetsvg/Z.svg'> <<ζ>> was in fact the closest approximation of [z]. While the notation of /f/ as <img class='img_src_inline' title='φ' alt='φ' src='alphabetsvg/F.svg'> <<φ>> may raise eyebrows at such an early point in time, its unvoiced labial quality is in all likelihood responsible for this application. Like /z/, /v/ was simply written as <img class='img_src_inline' title='φ' alt='φ' src='alphabetsvg/F.svg'> <<φ>> in some (presumably slightly earlier) inscriptions, while it is conveyed using the perhaps somewhat unexpected <img class='img_src_inline' title='θ' alt='θ' src='alphabetsvg/V.svg'> <<θ>> in others. While it may seem particularly weird to see the glyph we most commonly associate with either /tʰ/ or /θ/ to represent /v/, we can clearly see that the archaic glyph is remarkably similar to that used for its voiceless equivalent and as such, the repurposing of this glyph is not that curious. Worth noting is that both voiced fricatives were always written through as if they were voiceless when preceding a voiced obstruent.</p>
<p>The liquids /r l/ were expectedly written as <img class='img_src_inline' title='ρ' alt='ρ' src='alphabetsvg/R.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='λ' alt='λ' src='alphabetsvg/L.svg'> <<ρ λ>> while the semivowels employed their syllabic equivalents, i.e. /j w/ were written as <img class='img_src_inline' title='ι' alt='ι' src='alphabetsvg/I.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='υ' alt='υ' src='alphabetsvg/U.svg'> <<ι υ>>. Carite's /h/, which was unknown to the surrounding Ionians due to their psilosis but not to the Dorians, was conveyed with <img class='img_src_inline' title='η' alt='η' src='alphabetsvg/H.svg'> <<η>>. It is worth noting that in several inscriptions, /h/ is not notated at all, which may be due to influence from the surrounding Ionian colonies on the mainland. In either case, it is logical breathing diacritics are not in use, considering they were not invented and employed until well after these inscriptions were made. The representation of /ks/ as <img class='img_src_inline' title='ξ' alt='ξ' src='alphabetsvg/X.svg'> <<ξ>> and of /ps/ as <img class='img_src_inline' title='ψ' alt='ψ' src='alphabetsvg/PS.svg'> <<ψ>> follows the Ionian tradition as well.</p>
<h2>Vowels</h2>
<p>The non-mid vowels /a(ː) i(ː) u(ː)/ did historically not distinguish length orthographically and were simply written as <img class='img_src_inline' title='α' alt='α' src='alphabetsvg/A.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='ι' alt='ι' src='alphabetsvg/I.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='υ' alt='υ' src='alphabetsvg/U.svg'> <<α ι υ>>. The short mid vowels appear to have been conveyed using their expected glyphs, being <img class='img_src_inline' title='ε' alt='ε' src='alphabetsvg/E.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='ο' alt='ο' src='alphabetsvg/O.svg'> <<ε ο>> for /e o/. While Greek had four long mid vowels - /eː ɛː oː ɔː/ - Carite did not make such a distinction and only possessed /eː oː/. The digraphs <<ει ου>> we commonly associate with /eː oː/ in Greek were not in use in this region around this time period. As such, the use of the glyphs dedicated to /ɛː ɔː/ in Greek were generalised for all long mid vowels in Carite and we find <img class='img_src_inline' title='η' alt='η' src='alphabetsvg/H.svg'> <img class='img_src_inline' title='ω' alt='ω' src='alphabetsvg/OO.svg'> <<η ω>>. /øː/ appears to have ben conveyed using the digraph <img class='img_src_inline' title='ο' alt='ο' src='alphabetsvg/O.svg'><img class='img_src_inline' title='ι' alt='ι' src='alphabetsvg/I.svg'> <<οι>> while /yː/ poses a more interesting aspect of the contact with multiple Greek dialects. It is likely Ionian already had /y(ː)/ for their <<υ>> while others retained it as /u(ː)/ - in fact, they also happened to have different shapes. As mentioned earlier, Carite /u(ː)/ was written using Laconian <<υ>>, <img class='img_src_inline' title='υ' alt='υ' src='alphabetsvg/U.svg'>, - its front equivalent, /yː/, appears to have been conveyed with the Ionian <<y>>, <img class='img_src_inline' title='y' alt='y' src='alphabetsvg/Y.svg'>. It is noteworthy that the archaic glyphs appear to be the opposite of what we would expect nowadays.</p>
<h2>Writing direction</h2>
<p>All instances so far and all instances from now are conveyed by writing from left to right, but was this really the way the ancient Carites wrote? Due to their geographical proximity to the Greeks, let alone their usage of their alphabet, the main question is rather: which way did the Greeks write? While this is well beyond the scope of this chapter and readers are advised to consult §locscriptsgreece§ for a more in-depth explanation, it is likely the Carites, like their neighbours, primarily originally wrote in a <i>boustrophedon</i> manner before adopting a left to right approach. Indeed, almost all §lang_0 inscriptions do appear to be written from left to right - a single retrograde inscription may have its oddity explained rather simply by positing a left-handed writer.</p>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>An alternative reconstructional notation using the Latin alphabet is frequently employed and even preferred by some Caritologists. While it tends to simply represent the expected romanisations of the Greek orthography (including <<x>> for /ks/), it visually distinguishes the semivowels by employing <<j w>>. Additionally, the romanisation of [ŋ] differs between authors with some preferring <<g>>, analogically to many Greek romanisations, while most employ <<n>> in line with the nasal quality. /øː/ is simply represented as <<ø̄>>.</p>
<p>It is only logical the inscriptions did not include diacritics - the typical diacritical marks associated with tone were only invented by roughly 200 BC, with the rough and smooth breathings only appearing for the first time slightly prior. As such, it is impossible to ascertain if §lang_0 still had mobile stress - however, even if stress would be notated, it is possible this would have been historical spelling and would not reflect the actual stress.</p>
