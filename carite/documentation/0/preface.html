<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>Situating the origin of §lang_0 is a difficult task. The earliest independent Carite layer is generally dated to 500 BC near Narbonne, France. Given the presence of some PIE roots and formations that are considered to be exclusive to eastern branches, it seems likely the speakers had contact with early instances of Greek and Armenian before migrating further westwards with speakers of what would later become the Celtic language family. Dating the layers of the language's periods of intensive contact with its sister-languages and, later, non-Indo-European peoples is difficult, as much of its early history is obscured by the relative paucity and late attestation of records, but methods of internal reconstruction and comparison of shared innovations help shed some light on Carite's prehistory.</p>
<p>While we are able to both reconstruct a fairly accurate list of sound changes and a presumably mostly authentic orthography, the actual grammar is significantly harder due to the limited size of the corpus we may use for reference. With §lang_0 being a mostly reconstructed language and its further evolution during the Carite Dark Ages being entirely reconstructed, it is only logical everything below is an approximation based on the limited data we have - most notably, it may be incredibly tinted by what we know from the earliest attestations of a more modern Carite, roughly 1500 years after. It is highly likely several inflections were either still separate in §lang_0 or consisted of different varieties, with different grades in different suffixes for example - however, as these did not survive into later stages of the language and we have no attestations of them existing, they are purely hypothetical. As such, it is important to note that the morphology and grammar as described below is most likely flawed to some extent and it is possible we will never quite figure out the exact truth unless we find more attestations in the future.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, comparisons will be made with Proto-Celtic, Ancient Greek, Latin and Proto-Germanic, as these were the branches that are not only the closest geographically, but also appear to share numerous developments. While not overly relevant, comparisons with Armenian will be made due to its genetic affinity.</p>
<p>Due to the scope of this chapter, it is only logical that the development from Proto-Indo-European to §lang_0 involves the most prose and is highly technical. If you are interested in the history of Carite but perceive this chapter as too dense, you may find the other developmental chapters easier to understand.</p>
