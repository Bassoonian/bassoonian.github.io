<p>§lang_0 has a handful of attestations, of which most are direct and one is indirect, being written by Herodotus from a Greek point of view.</p>
<h2>Tartessos Inscription</h2>
<img src="images/tartessos_inscription.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Tartessos Inscription" title="Tartessos Inscription">
<p>The <b>Tartessos inscription</b> is a short sample of ancient Carite poetry written in the old Ionic Greek alphabet. It is one of the longer samples of continuous old Carite text, preserving three mostly complete lines and fragments of a fourth. The inscription was etched into the vessel before firing, and then cleaned up and painted over when the vase was complete. Stylistically, the vessel (more specifically, a form of oenochoe, a Greek wine-jug) belongs to the late geometric period by its simplistic decorations, similar to vessels from the eighth to sixth centuries. As it was meant for trade and was not a decorative piece, the vessel itself is very crudely decorated. The fourth line seems to have wrapped around the arms of the jug, and was lost with the loss of the jug arms themselves. It was found in an archaeological dig-site near Seville in 1911, relatively far from the Carite homelands, in what was once the Tartessian Gulf, further showing its purpose as a trade container. It represents one of the most important finds in Carite history.</p>

<h2>Spear</h2>
<p>A verdigris spearhead features a short text praising €NARBO€, presumably a river goddess. The usage of "to fly" with a sturgeon may seem odd, but sturgeons are known for leaping out of the water. Likewise, the shape of the spearhead resembles the head of a sturgeon. The original archeologist theoreticised that the verdigris colour is not the result of two millennia and a half of aging but was rather induced voluntarily in order to mimic a sturgeon's hide, but this is unsure.</p>

<h2>Herodotus' Histories</h2>
<p>In Herodotus' famous work, his <i>Histories</i>, a specific paragraph talks about §lang_0 and its people. While the actual textual fragment is peculiar for reasons that will be discussed later, it is by far the best and only source on the everyday life of the §lang_0 people as discussed in an earlier chapter.</p>
<p>The fragment of text posited by Herodotus must necessarily be taken with a grain of salt. Herodotus was, unsurprisingly, not a native §lang_0 speaker and transcribed a specific song from his Hellenic point of view. The fragment is as follows:</p>
<figure class="text-center">
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p> Γούζιεσι? Ἅλικι στρίβαντορ.</br>
            Δούνον βιύμενε ἁτπέριντι.</br>
            Ἵμενα δούφε ἕταλα τάλιοντι.</br>
            Κιέμι σκέλιετορ, ἴσρον γνάιετορ.</p>

<p>Several important features immediately stand out. The indication of stress confirm that, unless prefixed, words received initial stress. The aspiration, which was a feature at the time of Herodotus but not yet widespread at the time of earlier, primary §lang_0 sources, is used to mark /h/. Since Ancient Greek lacked /v/, Herodotus presumably resorted to using /b/ as a substitute, merging it with <<β>> (<i>b</i>) /b/. Lastly, the usage of <<ου>> (<i>ou</i>) for /u/ contrasts with the Greek use of <<υ>> (<i>u</i>), which represented /y/ instead.</p>
<p>Even with these quriks in mind, it is surprisingly difficult to match this fragment to what we know about §lang_0. It is through identifying additional Hellenisms, such as the representation of word-final §lang_0 <<-ομ>> (<i>-om</i>) as <<-ον>> (<i>-on</i>) or further analogies with the native language, such as the medial vowel of ἕταλα (<i>hétala</i>) reflecting grc@ἔταλον=étalon rather than its §lang_0 cognate °VITULUSCALF° - the rough breathing replacing the approximant will be elaborated on further.</p>
<p>Through the above assumptions, we can correctly connect the vast majority of etymons to §lang_0 reconstructions. However, three issues remain: the lack of the approximant in ἕταλα (<i>hétala</i>), the general lack of word-final /s/ and the widespread notation of faulty aspirations. While this has long puzzled early linguists, the consensus nowadays is that the fragment as transcribed by Herodotus featured two sound changes that are dated to very early §lang_1 and thus postdate all other §lang_0 attestations. The first is the initial prevocalic debuccalisation of /w/, which yields the aspiration we find in ἕταλα (<i>hétala</i>). The second is the debuccalisation of word-final /s/, which not only relates to the lack of word-final sibilants as noted above, but also translates to the faulty aspirations. It is likely Herodotus parsed word-final /h/, which was illegal in Ancient Greek, as aspiration of the vowel of the next word.</p>
<p>With the assumptions above, we can reconstruct the passage to have transcribed the following:</p>
