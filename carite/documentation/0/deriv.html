<h2>Derivational suffixes</h2>
<h3>Nominal</h3>
<h4>€-MN€</h4>
<p>°-MN° referred to the result or the instance of an action. °PAAMUN° from °PAMI° is one of the many examples.</p>
<h4>€-TATS€</h4>
<p>°-TATS° nominalised adjectives, describing a state of being. For example, °ANGWITATS° reflects °ANGWIS°.</p>
<h4>€-TRIS€ & €-TRII€</h4>
<p>°-TRIS° was the main agent suffix of §lang_0, yielding words such as °ARITRIS° from °ARJO°. Its feminine equivalent is °-TRII°.</p>
<h4>€-TROM€</h4>
<p>°-TROM°, which is the regular merger of pie@-trom and pie@-dʰrom, remained productive as instrument suffix. For example, °STEKTROM° is what was used to °STEGO°.</p>
<h4>€-EH2€</h4>
<p>°-EH2° simply derived feminine equivalents from o-stems. For example, °DEWA° is the female equivalent of °DEUS°.</p>
<h4>€-ISKOS€</h4>
<p>°-ISKOS° formed diminutives.</p>
<h3>Adjectival</h3>
<h4>€-YOS€</h4>
<p>°-YOS° applied the same possible mutations to the stem as the comparative derivation. °LUXINJOS° from °WOSNA° shows, like the suffix it reflects, a general belonging to something.</p>
<h4>€-AADOS€</h4>
<p>°-AADOS° indicated the possession of a thing or quality, yielding words such as °VZITADOS° from °VZITI°.</p>
<h4>€-IINOS€</h4>
<p>°-IINOS° derived adjectives from nominals, referring to materials, places and times. For example, °WLANINOS° was formed from °WLANA°.</p>
<h3>Verbal</h3>
<h4>€AHITI€</h4>
<p>°AHITI° formed denominatives and was attached to the stem of the noun. Additionally, any stem-final consonant (cluster) was voiced. An example is °WRADRAMI° from °WRATRA°.</p>
<h4>€OYMI€</h4>
<p>°OYMI° fromed factitives from adjectives and, like €AHITI€ voiced any stem-final consonant (cluster) it was attached to. Examples include °OGROIMI° from °OKRII°.</p>
