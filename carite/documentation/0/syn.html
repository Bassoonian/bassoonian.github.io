<p>A significant portion of §lang_0 syntax is reconstructed. The few attestations we have access to do not provide us with more than basic constructions. As such, a great portion of this chapter has been reconstructed through comparison with contemporary languages in its vicinity, as well as the syntax of later Carite.</p>
<h2>Verb Phrase</h2>
<p>The verb is the central element of any clause and, without exception, must be present in all clauses. A verb phrase is the combination of a verb and its objects, of which the number and type differ according to the type of verb, predicate complements and additional adverbials.</p>
<h3>Objects</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, the number and type of objects depend on the type of the verb. In the case of an intransitive verb, the object is excluded, while in the case of a transitive verb, it may be required.</p>
<h4>Intransitive Verbs</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, intransitive verbs did not take any object. Consider the following examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-0||</li>
</ul>
<p>Some intransitive verbs, such as the copula °VBCOPULA°, combined with a predicate complement consisting of a noun or adjective phrase. In this case, the predicate agrees in gender, number and case with the subject:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-4||</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some intransitive verbs required a complement clause, such as some impersonal ones:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-3||</li>
</ul>
<h4>Monotransitive Verbs</h4>
<p>Monotransitive verbs prototypically took a direct object, consisting of either a noun phrase or a pronoun. Direct objects were generally marked by the accusative case:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-13||</li>
</ul>
<p>Some verbs - the so called intransitives - had their direct objects marked with the instrumental case instead:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-6||</li>
</ul>
<p>Other monotransitives took an indirect object, rather than a direct object, which was marked by the dative case:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-9||</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, monotransitive verbs that generally took an object, as is the case for °IEAT°, meaning "to eat", were used without object to refer to the action:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-1||</li>
	<li>||SYN-7||</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bitransitive Verbs</h4>
<p>Some verbs took two objects, i.e. one direct object in the accusative or instrumental case and one indirect object in the dative case:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-8||</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complements</h3>
<p>Besides objects, verb phrases could also include complements which were situated between the objects and the verb or, in the case of passive constructions, between the participle and the copula. For example, a locative could be employed as a complement to indicate a static location:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-5||</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepositional phrases were also frequently employed to indicate a sense of direction or source:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-10||</li>
</ul>
<p>The instrumental case was employed not only for the obvious marking of instrumentals, but also for agentive expressions in passive constructions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-12||</li>
	<li>||SYN-11||</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adverbials</h3>
<p>For more information about adverbials and examples thereof, please consult the relevant chapter.</p>
<h2>Verbs</h2>
<h3>Person and Number</h3>
<p>As previously seen in the chapter on morphology, §lang_0 verbs inflected for person and number, reflecting three persons, first, second and third, and two numbers, singular and plural. These generally agreed with the subject noun phrase. If there was no clear subject, the suffix of the verb indicated the agent (or, in the case of a passive, the patient) of the sentence, as may be seen below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-14||</li>
	<li>||SYN-15||</li>
</ul>
<p>The usage of pronouns as a subject was as such not strictly necessary and generally only used in case of emphasis.</p>
<h4>Impersonal Verbs</h4>
<p>Some verbs could be used impersonally - that is, they appeared in the third person singular and do not have a noun phrase or pronoun as their subject. Examples include the so-called "weather-verbs":</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-2||</li>
</ul>
<p>Some impersonal verbs were accompanied by a complement clause, generally taking the subjunctive with its subject in the accusative:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-16||</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mood and Modality</h3>
<h4>Indicative</h4>
<p>The indicative objectively described an event or state of affairs, particularly in main clauses. It utilised °DONAWT° as its negative marker.</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-17||</li>
</ul>
<h4>Subjunctive</h4>
<p>The subjunctive almost exclusively appeared in subordinate clauses. It likewise used °DONAWT° to mark negations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-18||</li>
</ul>
<h4>Imperative</h4>
<p>The imperative was far more limited in terms of tense, person and number. Three forms exist, namely the second person singular and the first and second persons plural. The second person forms were used for commands or prohibitions, while the first person plural form can be roughly equated with "let us". The negative particle, also referred to as prohibition particle in this case, of the imperative was °REALLYDONAWT°.</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-19||</li>
	<li>||SYN-20||</li>
</ul>
<h3>Voice</h3>
<p>Proto-Indo-European possessed a synthetic distinction between active and mediopassive, which, as previously described in the chapter on verbal morphology, split into two separate verbal paradigms. In turn, we find a new analytical way to represent the passive voice, which contrasts with the simplex active endings. This passive was formed by inflecting the copula alongside the verb's past participle.</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-21||</li>
	<li>||SYN-22||</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conjunctive nominals</h2>
<p>One of the key defining features of Carite is the existence of conjunctive nominals. While these became strongly integrated with morphological alternations later, it is assumed that in §lang_0 times, this function was fulfilled by the single clitic °KWE°. Deriving from pie@-kʷe, where it connected different clauses on the same level, it is likely that it became conflated with the relative pronouns which were very similar. A near-identical usage of conjunctive nominals at this point in time is confirmed by the few attestations we have. More specifically, conjunctive nominals were the default way of introducing subordinate clauses. The word order of a subordinate clause is by default OSV as the first constituent of a subordinate clause must be phrase with a conjunctive nominal (either a noun phrase, or a prepositional phrase). For intransitive verbs, this would be their subject, while for transitives it would be their direct object (prototypically an accusative). This can also be an adpositional phrase, or a non-argument noun phrase in a non-core case with adverbial function; this is usually done for pragmatic topicalisation purposes.</p>
<h2>Adverbs</h2>
<p>§lang_0 did not inherit or innovate any adverbial marker; rather, it employed adjectives predicatively. For example, "quickly" would e.g. be conveyed as "as a quick [person]". This means that the adjective agreed in gender and number with the subject while also taking the nominative case.</p> -->
