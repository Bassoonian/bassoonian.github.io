<p>The Abean attestations combined with the morphosyntax of later Carite have allowed us to reconstruct a preliminary Abean syntax. However, due to the scarcity of material, some educated guesses are unfalsifiable but likewise uncertain. Equivalents in Latin and Greek are also provided.</p>
<h2>Noun Phrase</h2>
<p>A noun phrase (abbr. NP) in Abean is marked for case, number and gender, which are provided by the NP head and echoed on all congruent modifiers. The NP consists minimally of a noun or a nominalised adjective which act as its head. Personal pronouns cannot usually partake in a NP (specifically, they form a special pronominal phrase), but demonstrative pronouns could be nominalised and (rarely) take modifiers like regular nominalised adjectives. Only rarely, if at all, can personal pronouns be nominalised and become the head of a NP.</p>
<p>The Carite NP could consist of a bare N very frequently; this is paralleled more by classical Latin than Greek examples, since Latin did not use an article:</p>

<p>The undetermined Carite NP (and thus, a bare N) does not have an implied definiteness, which agrees with Latin and differs from Greek; the Greek article was not yet a full feature of Homeric Greek, and thus it's obvious that definiteness there is an innovation leading up to the Classical period.</p>
<p>The Carite NP can have a number of modifiers, which can either be congruent/agree with it in nominal features, or non-congruent. Congruent modifiers include adjectives and adjective phrases, determiners, demonstratives, numbers, apposited nouns, and noun phrases. Non-congruent modifiers include adpositional phrases, NPs in the genitive or instrumental with adverbial meaning, and subordinate clauses.</p>
<p>The NP head tends to precede its modifiers: Carite shows some of the same head-initial tendencies in NPs that Latin does, whereas Greek is more ambiguous. Determiners and demonstratives tend to more frequently appear before the head than other modifiers. Like in Greek, if more than one modifier comes before the head, the first one will always be a determiner or demonstrative; if the NP has both a determiner and demonstrative, then the determiner comes before the demonstrative. In this case, the demonstrative can behave like a regular adjectival modifier and will tend to be postposited rather than preposited.</p>
<p>Numbers in Carite behave much like adjectives in a NP, but are treated independently as they don't actually form an AdjP. In this way, Carite also resembles both Latin and Greek:</p>
<p>Unlike classical Greek, and much more like Homeric Greek and especially Latin, Carite does not have an article; thus, it does not mark for definiteness, and uses determiners only sparingly. Depending on the analysis, determiners can either form their own phrase governing a NP, or are part of the NP; in Carite, the second analysis seems more accurate. Even so, a regular Carite NP will have at most one optional determiner and only rarely will it also allow a demonstrative and nothing else. A determiner can be a demonstrative pronoun, a possessive prononun, a possessor phrase in the genitive or dative, a quantifier or an interrogative.</p>
<p>Appositing two noun phrases is another viable NP formation tactic in Carite. In such an apposition, the head tends to come first, though light modifiers (such as a single noun in a NP) can come before their head even in apposition. Here there's little disagreement between Greek, Latin and Carite. Like Greek but more unlike Latin, Carite is more generous with using nouns in apposition where one would in translation (and, furthermore, in Latin) expect a noun.</p>
<p>Since modifiers tend to refer to the N or NP directly preceding them, this constrains their position when there is an NP with an apposition in it that they modify; in such a case, they come before the head of their NP. If they modify a NP that is itself apposited to another, the modifiers are postposited regularly, as shown in the following comparison:</p>
<p>The NP head tends to precede its modifiers; determiners and demonstratives tend to more frequently appear before the head than other modifiers; if more than one modifier comes before the head, then the first one will always be a determiner or demonstrative. If the NP has both a determiner and demonstrative, then the determiner comes before the demonstrative; in this case, the demonstrative can behave like a regular adjectival modifier and will tend to be postposited rather than preposited.</p>
<p>Since modifiers tend to refer to the N or NP directly preceding them, this constrains their position when there is an apposited NP: they have to come before any apposited NP, so that they're not interpreted as referring to that NP.</p>
<p>Relative clauses must come after their NP, and will also almost always come after all other modifiers; NPs with a relative clause will more often preposit their other modifiers, except apposited NPs.</p>
<h2>Adjective Phrase</h2>
<p>An adjective phrase minimally consists of an adjective, optionally with adverb or adpositional phrase modifiers. Modifiers tend to come after the head; single-word adverb modifiers are allowed to come before the head, while larger adverb phrase modifiers and practically all adpositional phrases must be postposited.</p>
<h2>Adverbials</h2>
<h3>Adverb Phrase</h3>
<p>An adverb phrase consists minimally of an adverb (single word or phrasal), with optional modifiers which are in turn adverbs or AdP. Specially, an AdP can consist of a PP modified by another AdP; in this case, the PP acts like an AdP.</p>
<h3>Prepositional Phrase</h3>
<p>Prepositional phrases consist of an adposition and a NP in the case determined by the adposition.</p>
<h2>Verb Syntax</h2>
<p>Finite verbs form finite predicates; a clause must have a finite verb in them. A verb phrase consists of at least one verb, and can contain other non-finite verbs governed by the finite verb; this is common with periphrastic constructions like passives or modal verbs. the main verb of the phrase agrees with its subject in person and number, and the non-finites, if applicable, will agree in number, case, gender with the finite verb's subject.</p>
<h3>Participle Phrase</h3>
<p>Participle phrases are a special type of adjectival phrase where the participle can still retain some arguments from the VP that generated it; it will always include only direct and indirect objects, and never subjects (in the syntactic, not semantic sense).</p>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<p>Verbs have a lexically determined number of core or obligatory arguments: none in the case of impersonal verbs, one in the case of intransitive verbs, and at least two in the case of transitive verbs. A verb is considered transitive only if it has a subject and a direct object. Arguments are best analysed as not being in the surface verb phrase: only deep-level analyses require arguments to be part of the VP, whereas on the surface this would result in numerous discontinuous phrases for no practical gain. A direct object must either be in the accusative without prepositions, or occasionally in the instrumental if required by the choice of verb. All other cases will either be in adpositional phrases, or be adverbials, adjuncts or indirect objects.</p>
