<p>A significant portion of §lang_0 syntax is reconstructed. The few attestations we have access to do not provide us with more than basic constructions. As such, a great portion of this chapter has been reconstructed through comparison with contemporary languages in its vicinity, as well as the syntax of later Carite.</p>
<h2>Verb Phrase</h2>
<p>The verb is the central element of any clause and, without exception, must be present in all clauses. A verb phrase is the combination of a verb and its objects, of which the number and type differ according to the type of verb, predicate complements and additional adverbials.</p>
<h3>Objects</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, the number and type of objects depend on the type of the verb. In the case of an intransitive verb, the object is excluded, while in the case of a transitive verb, it may be required.</p>
<h4>Intransitive Verbs</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, intransitive verbs did not take any object. Consider the following examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-0||</li>
	<li>||SYN-1||</li>
	<li>||SYN-2||</li>
</ul>
<p>Some intransitive verbs, such as the copula °VBCOPULA°, combined with a predicate complement consisting of a noun or adjective phrase. In this case, the predicate agrees in gender, number and case with the subject:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-4||</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some intransitive verbs required a complement clause, such as some impersonal ones:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-3||</li>
</ul>
<h4>Monotransitive Verbs</h4>
<p>Monotransitive verbs prototypically took a direct object, consisting of either a noun phrase or a pronoun. Direct objects were generally marked by the accusative case:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-5||</li>
</ul>
<p>Some verbs - the so called intransitives - had their direct objects marked with the instrumental case instead:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-6||</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, monotransitive verbs generally take an object, as is the case for °IEAT°, meaning "to eat", but may also be used without object to refer to the action:</p>
<ul>
	<li>||SYN-8||</li>
	<li>||SYN-7||</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conjunctive nominals</h2>
<p>One of the key defining features of Carite is the existence of conjunctive nominals. While these became strongly integrated with morphological alternations later, it is assumed that in §lang_0 times, this function was fulfilled by the single clitic °KWE°. Deriving from pie@-kʷe, where it connected different clauses on the same level, it is likely that it became conflated with the relative pronouns which were very similar. A near-identical usage of conjunctive nominals at this point in time is confirmed by the few attestations we have. More specifically, conjunctive nominals were the default way of introducing subordinate clauses. The word order of a subordinate clause is by default OSV as the first constituent of a subordinate clause must be phrase with a conjunctive nominal (either a noun phrase, or a prepositional phrase). For intransitive verbs, this would be their subject, while for transitives it would be their direct object (prototypically an accusative). This can also be an adpositional phrase, or a non-argument noun phrase in a non-core case with adverbial function; this is usually done for pragmatic topicalisation purposes.</p>
<h2>Adverbs</h2>
<p>§lang_0 did not inherit or innovate any adverbial marker; rather, it employed adjectives predicatively. For example, "quickly" would e.g. be conveyed as "as a quick [person]". This means that the adjective agreed in gender and number with the subject while also taking the nominative case.</p> -->
