<p>The following people are noted for being especially important in the history of Carite and/or caritology. They are ordered chronologically by birth date. Non-fictional individuals include a link to Wikipedia.</p>
<h2>Herodotus</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus" target="_blank">Herodotus</a> (c. 484 - c. 424 BC)</b></p>
<h2>Guillermo de Toledo</h2>
<p><b>Guillermo de Toledo (1632-1667)</b> was a Spanish philosopher and translator of the Renaissance era. Little is known about his life, and the few pieces of apocryphal biographical information report otherwise contradict each other. What is known is that he published what is assumed to be the first grammar of the Carite language in 1665. The original version of this work was lost, however, and it is only attested fragmentarily in translations from Latin to Spanish.</p>
<h2>Karl Verner</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Verner" target="_blank">Karl Adolf Verner</a> (1846-1896)</b></p>
<h2>Holger Pedersen</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Pedersen_(linguist)" target="_blank">Holger Pedersen</a> (1867-1953)</b></p>
<h2>Adolf Schulten</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Schulten" target="_blank">Adolf Schulten</a> (1870-1960)</b></p>
<h2>Edmundo Davide</h2>
<p><b>Edmundo Davide (1887-1963)</b> was a Colombian linguist and botanist. In the early 20th century, he moved to his father's native Italy and studied linguistics with Alfredo Trombetti at the University of Bologna. His main linguistic focuses were languages with few attestations, both classical and modern. His 1959 paper on the phonological evolution from Proto-Indo-European to Abean would lead to the posthumously named <b>Davide's Law</b>, which describes the origin and conditioning of Abean-exclusive a-vocalisms.</p>
<h2>Francisco Franco</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco" target="_blank">Francisco Franco Bahamonde</a> (1892-1975)</b></p>
<h2>Pierre Chantraine</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Chantraine" target="_blank">Pierre Chantraine</a> (1899-1974)</b></p>
<h2>Katarina Michael</h2>
<p><b>Katarina Michael (1903-1997)</b> was a Danish philologist. Born to German parents in Copenhagen, she studied under Holger Pedersen. Their later joint effort in decyphering the recently dug up Tartessos inscription and classifying it as an independent Indo-European branch is widely regarded as the starting point of caritology. She later became one of the pioneers in Hittite studies with many of her papers proposing etymologies being the basis of the etymological dictionaries of today.</p>
<h2>Pierre-Jean Lefèvre</h2>
<p><b>Pierre-Jean Lefèvre (1943-1996)</b> was a French Germanist. Originally specialised in Old Norse, his field of interest later expanded to historical linguistics and subsequently Western European philology. Within caritology, which he only occasionally dabbled in, he is best remembered for <b>Lefèvre's Law</b>, which affected sequences of a plosive and a liquid in §lang_1, helping bridge the gap between §lang_0 and §lang_2. Other accomplishments include his contributions to figuring out the the periodisation of runestones by epigraphic evidence.</p>
<h2>Klaus Engels</h2>
<p><b>Klaus Engels (°1963)</b> is a Dutch philologist and Indo-European scholar. He graduated from the University of Leiden in 1985 and obtained his PhD in 1989 under supervision of Robert S. P. Beekes, in which he proposed the function of <b>Engels' Law</b>, which was responsible for the glottalisation and voicing of word-initial laryngeal-consonant clusters in the evolution from Proto-Indo-European to §lang_0. His later work continues to focus on attestations and writings from the ancient Hellenosphere, with his most recent publication examining several Linear A fragments found on the Cyclades. He occasionally appears as a guest professor in Leiden's summer school.</p>
<h2>Svetlana Burlak</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Burlak" target="_blank">Svetlana Burlak</a> (°1969)</b></p>
<h2>Valentina Palbán</h2>
<p><b>Valentina Sierra Palbán Montae (°1993)</b></p>
