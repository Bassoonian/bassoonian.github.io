<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Welcome to the homepage of <b>Carite</b>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages" target="_blank">Indo-European</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language" target="_blank">constructed language</a> made by <b>Iasper</b> and <b>Darkgamma</b>. What originally started as a small project the 29th of June, 2015, quickly grew into a widely praised feat, earning a rare purple flair on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/" target="_blank">/r/conlangs subreddit</a> two years into its existence with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/69ktl7/redefining_ielangs_introducing_carisitt/" target="_blank">a single post</a> and cementing its status of one of the longest living collaborations. Since then, it has undergone several reworks and is now widely considered to be one of the highest effort constructed languages ever made.</p>
<p>Carite has been awarded on several occasions:
	<ul>
		<li>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/">/r/conlangs</a>' <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/s4nmjv/best_of_rconlangs_2021/">Best of /r/conlangs 2021</a>, an award was given to both this site as a whole and Heyra, the Carite opera;</li>
		<li>The <a href="https://conlang.org">Language Creation Society</a> awarded Heyra with the <a href="https://twitter.com/FiatLingua/status/1356693862492766210">2021 LCS Presidents' Scholarship</a>.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>Practical notes</h2>
<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>Any piece of text besides this introductory page is presented as if in-universe. While a solid 90% of this does indeed correspond to what has happened in real life, anything that specifically pertains to the Carite people and their language is evidently fictional. Nonetheless, the greatest care has been taken to adhere as closely as possible to the laws of linguistics so that this language may hypothetically have existed today. Likewise, the early history has been preserved as intactly as possible - only in the early modern age are there any more significant changes to the course of history, which are once again as realistic as possible.</p>
<p>Besides being a hard science constructed language, with as many source references as possible, there is the occasional apparition of artistic liberty. More specifically, several words in the lexicon do not have any real etymology and are presented in-universe as being of unknown or of substrate origin - while this is also the case for many other branches, it is impossible to accurately reconstruct most Pre-Indo-European substrates (Pre-Greek being a very notable exception) and this feature thus provides a mostly realistic way of concealing artistic liberty. Nonetheless, when consulting the Sources tab of etymons that are not based on science, an alert will appear to inform the reader that any information mentioned in that specific entry is to be discarded in any potentially scientific research.</p>
<p>With each lexicon entry's etymology tab being as elaborate as possible, the Carite lexicon may also prove to be a useful compilation of many sources on Proto-Indo-European that are conveniently summarised and elaborated upon if necessary. Despite the ease of access, directly sourcing it as a source in academic contexts is highly discouraged due to the occasional fictional addition (even if these are explicitly marked as such) - however, each lexicon entry mentions a very specific page of the source used and includes links to facilitate lookups in fully trustworthy sources.</p>
<p>When it comes to worldbuilding, it is inevitable that this alternative history setting means the Carite people are affected by the actions of real life figures; as such, claiming that any resemblance is coincidental is uncalled for. Great care has been taken to make sure that if actions are attributed to a non-fictional individual, they are things that this particular individual would have been capable of, both positively and negatively. As such, several real life scientists have been fictively given new accomplishments, while others who have had a less positive connotation historically, such as Francisco Franco, have had their actions also negatively affect the Carite people, just as they in all likelihood would have if this history had taken place for real. No legacies of individuals were purposefully impoverished in the Carite history.</p>
<h3>Wiktionary links</h3>
<p>In each entry's etymology tab, links to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wiktionary</a> pages are included for cognates and etymologies. While these are included to give readers the opportunity to browse around, Wiktionary is a free resource and as such often inaccurate and/or incomplete. These links are automatically generated for your comfort and as such may link to non-existing pages. If this is the case, please refer to the bibliography tab for further reading.</p>
