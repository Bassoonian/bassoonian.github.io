<h2>The Abeans</h2>
<p>The earliest layer of Carite is referred to as <b>Abean</b>, which is what the speakers (or possibly a subgroup of the Proto-Carites) called themselves in antiquity. We possess a handful of attestations that allow us to date this period to around 500 BC with the Abean speakers most likely having resided in what is now Narbonne, France. These attestations will be discussed in great detail in the relevant chapter.</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>The anthropologic goldmine for Abean is a chapter from Herodotus' <i>Histories</i>, which documents his experience with the people and also describes their culture and traditions. While it postdates the attestations, and thus the general timing of Abean, by about 70 years, it still provides us with the most information by far. The passage is as follows:</p>

        <p>Πρὸς τῶν Οὐκοντίων δυσμαῖς ἔθνος ἐστιν, ὃν οἱ Κέλτοι Ἀβίους μὲν ὀνομάζουσιν, ὀνομαζόμενους Ἀουίους δ’ ἐν τῇ αὑτου γλώσσῃ. Ἡ μὲν ῥίγιν ἄρχουσα γῆ πᾶσα τοῖς αὐτουργοῖς σπείρειν διαραίρηται, οἱ δὲ ἅπας τὸν ἀγρόν κέκτηται. Ὁ αὐτουργός μόνος σύν τῷ δώματι τρέφεσθαι τῷ ἀγρῷ δύναται, ὡς γὰρ ἄλλως φόρον σπανίως φέρει.</p>
		<p>Κατὰ τὸν τῶν Ἀβίων πλοῦτος οὐ μεγάλον ἐόν ἕκατος ἐλεύθερός ἐστίν, καὶ τέχνη τε παιδείη εὐγενέες. Θεούς Σκάνδιν, Τριόνην, Οὐνίον, Σελήνην Αβίην, καὶ Ἀφροδίτην τε Ἠελίον σεβάζονται. Ὅφρ' ἀποδέχωνται τόδε τῷ ἔᾰρῐ φωνέουσιν:</p>

		Κιέμι σκέλιετορ, ἴσρομ γνάιετορ.</p>

        <p>To the west of the Vocontii there is a people that the Celts call Abioi, and in their own language Avioi. All the land that the <i>rigi</i> or <i>stergekwos</i> rules is parcelled out for peasants to farm, and everyone owns their own plot of land. The plot can feed only the farmer and his family, and they seldom pay a tribute besides.</p>
		<p>The wealth of the land of the Abeans is not great, but all men are free, and have noble arts and culture. They praise their gods Skandi, Priona and Hunjos, the Abean Selene, Aphrodite and Helios, and they sing a song to embrace spring:</p>
		<p>Γούζιεσι? Ἅλικι στρίβαντορ.</br>
		Δούνον βιύμενε ἁτπέριντι.</br>
		Ἵμενα δούφε ἕταλα τάλιοντι.</br>
		Κιέμι σκέλιετορ, ἴσρομ γνάιετορ.</p>
		<p>They sing and they dance, and their musicians play <i>dwikolmos</i>, made from the wood of the willow tree. It is twoheaded, shorter than the Greek aulos, and has a higher voice. Moreover, the chiefs and nobles also hold a great number of riches from other countries, and they most of all love Greek merchandise. Some among the Abeans can also read and write, though not very skilfully, in the Ionic alphabet.</p>

<h3>Naming</h3>
<p>The English name <b>Abean</b> comes from a Late Latin derivation of the Greek Ἀβίος (<i>Abíos</i>), which it in turn borrowed from local Celtic speakers. Herodotus mentions they referred to themselves as Ἀουίοι (Aouíoi). This endonym is of unclear origin. The current consensus is that it reflects an Abean °0#ABEANUS°, with /v/ having been approximated as /b/ by the Celts and /w/ by the Greeks as both lacked /v/.</p>
<h3>Social hierarchy</h3>
<p>Herodotus' use of ἔθνος (<i>éthnos</i>) as opposed to e.g. δῆμος (<i>dêmos</i>) implies they regarded the Abeans as lacking the same political complexity the Greeks possessed. Indeed, his description seems to point towards a somewhat rudimentary organisation. °0#REXKING° evidently points towards a cognate word of "king", while its synonym is less obvious. It is likely the Abean king Herodotus came into contact with was called °0#STERGEKWOS° - a name that may be modeled after grc@Φίλιππος=Phílippos - and that he erroneously parsed the personal name as a plain noun.</p>
<p>Noteworthily, Herodotus appears to mention that everyone is free. This appears to indicate that the principles of slavery, had not (yet) been adopted by the Abeans at this time.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Much like his observations of Egyptians and others, Herodotus had the habit of applying the so-called <i>interpretatio graeca</i> to foreign pantheons. This yielded comparisons and equations of foreign deities with gods from the Greek pantheon, which gives us a fair idea of what they were revered for. The three examples of deities Herodotus gives are °0#MOONGOD°, °0#PROINA° and °0#SUNGOD°. Besides their equations to the Greek deities of the moon, love and the sun, respectively, not much is known about their function in antiquity, but they appear a millennium and a half later in the medieval mythological chronologies. A fourth deity, °0#PERKUNAS°, is mentioned in the Tartessos inscription (see the Abean attestations page for more information), and likewise reappears in a medieval context.</p>
<h3>Song</h3>
<p>Herodotus' attestation of an Abean song stands out, both because it was written down by a Greek speaker and because it differs phonologically from the other attestations, and will be discussed linguistically on the relevant page. The only noteworthy piece of information appears to be a correlation between willows and life. This connection may have originated from the possible medicinal properties of willow wood as documented by other authors from antiquity, but this is unsure.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Herodotus mentions the °0#DWIKOLMOS°, an ancient woodwind instrument made from willow wood. Like some variants of the Greek aulos, they consisted of two separate pipes with a double reed each. Interstingly, they appear to be made of willow wood specifically. It is possible that this linked into the association of willows and life as discussed above and that these instruments were maybe used for specific religious purposes specifically for rituals involving the celebration of life, but this is pure speculation. Unlike the aulos, the €0#DWIKOLMOS€ is not attested archeologically and the length of each of pipe, as well as the amount of holes is unknown. The only reference is that it was shorter (and subsequently higher) than its Greek equivalent.</p>
<h3>Trade and literacy</h3>
<p>The fact the Abeans and Ancient Greeks engaged in trade is easily provable thanks to loans and borrowed technology. We do indeed find the native attestations in an adaptation of the Ionic alphabet; for what reason Herodotus considered them to be less skillful is unclear.</p>
<!-- <h2>Carite Dark Ages</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, from the 4th century BC onwards, there is a significant gap in attestations. We may find Tacitus reference a group of people - the <i>Caristii</i> - living in the Iberian Peninsula; however, there is no description of the language they speak, only a single mythological sample featuring the Latinisation of a deity.</p>
<h2>Middle Ages</h2>
<p>Besides some sporadic inscriptions that started popping up from around the 7th century onwards, there are not a lot of Carite attestations prior to the rise of the <b>Carite Kingdom</b> in 997. Starting as a popular uprising in the middle of the political turmoil of the Reconquista, this political entity (which was also referred to as <i>X</i> in Medieval Latin and <i>Z</i> in Old Spanish) was eventually reannexed in 1129.</p>
<h2>Early Modern Age</h2>
<p>In 1818, Neuquen proclaimed independence as part of the decolonisation of the Americas.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco" target="_blank">Francisco Franco</a> (1892-1975) attained power in 1939, he introduced laws suppressing all languages other than Castilian Spanish. When Franco died in 1975, Catalan, Galician and Basque were heavily injured but managed to survive this challenging ordeal - however, the same can not be said for European Carite, whose last native speaker passed away before the stigma fully faded away.</p>
<h2>History of Caritology</h2>
<p>Carite was variously included or excluded from the early Indo-European grouping proposals. It wasn't until 1947, when Spanish philosopher (and secondarily philologist) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Zubiri" target="_blank">Xavier Zubiri</a> (1898-1983) published the <i>X</i>, a treatise in which he attempted to connect Carite, medieval records dating from the Carite Kingdom and the inscriptions from Narbonne, France. At the time of this publication, Franco ruled Spain and his dictatorship also oppressed Zubiri's works. Contrary to most of the Spanish academics, who were not only sceptical of his claims but also reprimanded him over spending attention on a minority language, the Carite Academy in Neuquen enthusiastically received the treatise and started their own research, using Zubiri's work as a base. Eventually, they managed to prove his assumptions through thorough internal reconstruction, cementing Carite's status as an Indo-European language. Other noteworthy contributing philologists include the Limburger Klaus Engels (°1963), who solved the issue of word-initial consonant inconsistencies (now commonly known as Engels' Law), and the Dane Karl Verner (1846-1896) - while not directly responsible for Carite discoveries, the famous Verner's Law for Proto-Germanic was posthumously expanded upon by Caritologists to explain Carite voicing inconsistencies, yielding Verner's Carite Law.</p> -->
