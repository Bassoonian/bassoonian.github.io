<h2>Antiquity</h2>
<p>The early history of the Carite people is not the most clear. We may find several attestations that can be dated to roughly 500 BC around Narbonne, France - enough for us to reconstruct the general tendencies of an alphabet, but not much more.</p>
<h3>Tombstone</h3>
<p>The longest attestation of §lang_0 is a limestone inscription, presumably part of a funerary monument.</p>
<h3>Spear</h3>
<p>A small spear bears the name of the local river goddess. It is unclear if it was sacrificed to her or if it was actively used for hunting.</p>
<h3>Trading Papyrus</h3>
<p>A small fragment of papyrus records the contract of a trade. It is poorly preserved with many words or letters requiring reconstruction.</p>
<h3>Vase</h3>
<p>A small vase bears the depiction of a mythological event with names of deities written next to the figures.</p>
<h2>Carite Dark Ages</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, from the 4th century BC onwards, there is a significant gap in attestations. We may find Tacitus reference a group of people - the <i>Caristii</i> - living in the Iberian Peninsula; however, there is no description of the language they speak, only a single mythological sample featuring the Latinisation of a deity.</p>
<h2>Middle Ages</h2>
<p>Besides some sporadic inscriptions that started popping up from around the 7th century onwards, there are not a lot of Carite attestations prior to the rise of the <b>Carite Kingdom</b> in 997. Starting as a popular uprising in the middle of the political turmoil of the Reconquista, this political entity (which was also referred to as <i>X</i> in Medieval Latin and <i>Z</i> in Old Spanish) was eventually reannexed in 1129.</p>
<h2>Early Modern Age</h2>
<p>In 1818, Neuquen proclaimed independence as part of the decolonisation of the Americas.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco" target="_blank">Francisco Franco</a> (1892-1975) attained power in 1939, he introduced laws suppressing all languages other than Castilian Spanish. When Franco died in 1975, Catalan, Galician and Basque were heavily injured but managed to survive this challenging ordeal - however, the same can not be said for European Carite, whose last native speaker passed away before the stigma fully faded away.</p>
<h2>History of Caritology</h2>
<p>Carite was variously included or excluded from the early Indo-European grouping proposals. It wasn't until 1947, when Spanish philosopher (and secondarily philologist) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Zubiri" target="_blank">Xavier Zubiri</a> (1898-1983) published the <i>X</i>, a treatise in which he attempted to connect Carite, medieval records dating from the Carite Kingdom and the inscriptions from Narbonne, France. At the time of this publication, Franco ruled Spain and his dictatorship also oppressed Zubiri's works. Contrary to most of the Spanish academics, who were not only sceptical of his claims but also reprimanded him over spending attention on a minority language, the Carite Academy in Neuquen enthusiastically received the treatise and started their own research, using Zubiri's work as a base. Eventually, they managed to prove his assumptions through thorough internal reconstruction, cementing Carite's status as an Indo-European language. Other noteworthy contributing philologists include the Limburger Klaus Engels (°1963), who solved the issue of word-initial consonant inconsistencies (now commonly known as Engels' Law), and the Dane Karl Verner (1846-1896) – while not directly responsible for Carite discoveries, the famous Verner's Law for Proto-Germanic was posthumously expanded upon by caritologists to explain Carite voicing inconsistencies, yielding Verner’s Carite Law.</p>
