<h1>Preface</h1>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<b>§lang_4</b> refers to the language spoken during the Carite Kingdom.
<h2>Registers</h2>
<p>Due to the sizable corpus of §lang_4, we are able to clearly distinguish between two registers: a modern and an archaic one. Small traces of laws, which were not destroyed upon the annexation of the kingdom, appear to have been written in the modern register, presumably related due to the independence of the kingdom being the result of a popular uprising. The vast majority of attestations, however, appear to be written in a more archaic way. This includes most of the poetry, including the mythology. The difference between these two registers will be elaborated on in their respective chapters.</p>
