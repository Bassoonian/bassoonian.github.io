<h1>Orthography</h1>
<p>The norm of §lang_4 spelling is based on a normalisation of the manuscript tradition that was common at the time, with heavy reference to the modern orthographical standard, as well as the norms of representing Old Portuguese, Castilian and Leonese spoken in the region. The source of the letters <<Ñ Ł>>, used to represent /ɲ ʎ/, is originally from scribal abbreviations for double consonants, as these letters were written double (c.f. Old Portuguese and Old Spanish of the time), which was abbreviated to one letter with a tilde. In Modern Spanish, this was retained only for the nasal <<Ñ>>, but not for the lateral, which remained written double <<LL>>; in Carite, the palatal lateral was more commonly written with a tilde, superscripted or later written atop the letter itself, which for typographical convenience is here represented with a straight barred L, hence <<Ł>>.</p>
