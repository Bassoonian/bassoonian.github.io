<h2>Phonotactics</h2>
||PHONOTACTICS||
<h2>Suprasegmentals</h2>
<p>The analysis of stress varies, but the one presented here is the most common. Stress is always penultimate, unless the antepenultimate syllable has a coda, in which case that syllable receives stress instead. Apparent violations can easily be explained through the presence of an additional empty syllable, which causes final or, per the rules above, potentially penultimate stress instead.</p>
<h2>Morphophonology</h2>
<p>§lang_4 contains a great deal of surface filters besides the active voicing assimilation filter. For example, if a word-final plosive is preceded by a nasal, it is nasalised. Likewise, if a word-final sonorant would be syllabic due to phonotactic constraints, it ejects an /a/ before it.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the semivowels are not truly phonemic in a morphonological sense. Instead, ||i u|| may surface as |j w| in several cases. More specifically, intervocalically.</p>
<p>Several bare suffixes apply palatalisation to the last consonant of the stem, making it usually written as |ʲ|. The outcome of these changes generally matches the historical palatalisation that took place:</p>
<ul>
	<li>|pʲ bʲ| spirantise and yield /f v/;</li>
	<li>|tʲ dʲ| generally undergo full palatalisation and surface as /ʃt ʒd/. However, when preceded by |ʃ|, the full cluster yields /ʃʃ/ or /ʒʒ/;</li>
	<li>|kʲ gʲ| similarly palatalise but in a different manner, yielding /t͡ʃ d͡ʒ/;</li>
	<li>|sʲ zʲ| are slightly retracted to /ʃ ʒ/;</li>
	<li>If a word-final soronant would otherwise eject /a/, it ejects /i/ instead;</li>
	<li>All other consonants are unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we find several sequences of a consonant and |j| merge, yielding a different consonant or sequence. More specifically, it involves the following changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The clusters |nj ɲj| is simplified to /ɲ/ or /j/ post-consonantally;</li>
	<li>The same goes for laterals with |lj| and |ʎj| both surfacing as /ʎ/ or /j/ post-consonantally;</li>
	<li>|t͡sj/ undergoes palatalisation and yields /t͡ʃ/;</li>
	<li>The palatal element is neutralised in |ʃj ʒj|, yielding /ʃ ʒ/;</li>
	<li>The clusters |kwj gwj| surface as /kj gj/.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Difference in registers</h2>
<p>While it is assumed the archaic register mostly matched the modern one in terms of pronunciation, we find evidence that there were some minor differences in pronunciation. For example, the modern register dropped all word-final consonants that did not directly follow a vowel, while they remained written and pronounced in the archaic register.</p>
