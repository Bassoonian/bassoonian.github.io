<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Thematic</h2>
<p>In the thematic verbs, a handful of verbs appeared to undergo a shift in stem in several forms, most notably the second and third person singular as well as the second person plural. By Â§lang_4 times, however, one form had ousted the other and the only alternating stems remained the primary and the future stem. In most cases, the primary stem was generalised - for a few verbs, which were presumably used more often in second and third person context, the i-umlaut stem was generalised instead.</p>
