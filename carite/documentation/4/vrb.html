<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<p>As was the case for the nominals, the stress patterns in the verbs had shifted somewhat from their expected outcome. For example, in stems ending on a light syllable, the verb often received final stress in all present forms, as well as a minority in the past forms; in reality, however, we find radical stress on all past forms. This may be explained through differet means. First of all is the merger between past and present of the first and second person plural, so a change of stress may have prevented ambiguity. Secondly, the past tense had radical stress everywhere else - in the fact, the only difference between past and present in the third person plural. This way of marking tense may subsequently have spread to the other plural forms. In verbs with a stem on a heavy syllable, the stress is identical and no actual distinction is made. These changes took place across the board for transitive thematics, as well as the subjunctive in resonantals and both indicative and subjunctive in vocalics.</p>
<p>In the intransitives, a similar but opposite shift occurred, with the second person singular present indicative receiving radical stress present like the rest of the present.</p>
<h2>Thematic</h2>
<p>In the thematic verbs, a handful of verbs appeared to undergo a shift in stem in several forms, most notably the second and third person singular as well as the second person plural. By Â§lang_4 times, however, one form had ousted the other and the only alternating stems remained the primary and the future stem. In most cases, the primary stem was generalised - for a few verbs, which were presumably used more often in second and third person context, the i-umlaut stem was generalised instead.</p>
