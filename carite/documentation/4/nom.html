<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<h3>Modern loss of cases</h3>
<p>While the attestations in a more archaic register of §lang_4 cleanly continue to reflect the four-case system of §lang_3 - that is, nominative, accusative, genitive and dative - we find a significantly different usage in the modern register, more specifically regarding the usage of the nominative and accusative cases. In nouns, the nominative case appears to have been usurped by the accusative case entirely, while in adjectives, it the nominative case is only used adverbially. In personal pronouns, however, the clear distinction between nominative and accusative appears to remain. Since §lang_4 is generally analysed from an archaic point of view - that is, one with a nominative/accusative distinction - it is important to be aware of the vastly different usage of these cases in modern inscriptions. However, with the generalisation of the accusative forms in all future phases of Carite evolution, the dictionary form that is employed from §lang_4 onwards tends to be the accusative for nouns and adjectives instead.</p>
<h3>Modern loss of neuter</h3>
<p>With the generalisation of the accusative forms in the modern register, the only difference between masculine and neuter forms would be the accusative plural forms. We can, however, safely say that the masculine forms were completely generalised in the modern register, with them only remaining distinct in the archaic register. This notion is confirmed by the presence of overarchaicisms - the usage of a neuter plural form for an etymologically masculine noun.</p>
<h3>Loss of Exon</h3>
<p>With the loss of many word-final vowels, we already found a gradual merger of Exon's nouns into the regular inflection back in §lang_3. This process must have extended and completed by §lang_4 times as we no longer find any Exon's nouns in neither register.</p>

<p>As elaborated on above, the alternate plural accusative/nominative plural only appears in the archaic register (in which it hypercorrectly spread to several masculine nouns).</p>
