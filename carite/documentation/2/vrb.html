<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<h3>Delta and Alpha</h3>
<p>As is the case for nouns, verbs were split into two subcategories that were originally based on the last vowel of their stem before vowel harmony took place.</p>
<h3>I-umlaut</h3>
<p>The stem alteration caused by i-umlaut was grammaticalised, although the exact occurrences vary between inflection paradigms. Generally, but not always, the alternate vowel is shared with the future stem.</p>
<h3>Past Stems</h3>
<p>The loss of short, unstressed, word-initial vowels after the shift to penultimate stress had thorough implications on the verbal system, as this also affected the augment. In many verbs that started with a consonant, the vowel was simply lost. When it started with a prevocalic voiced plosive, however, the previous allophone of intervocalic /b d g/ phonemicised, yielding initial /β ð ɣ/. This process was fully morphologised.</p>
<p>Besides these regular alterations, we also find an increase in irregular past stems. The stative preterites from §lang_1 and earlier had fully merged into the regular endings, also for intransitives, simply yielding an irregular past stem. Only rarely did this separate stem undergo the otherwise regular past mutation. Another source </p>
<p>Finally, past participles, which previously did not show the augment, now fully share their stem with the past forms.</p>
<h3>Transitive and intransitive exchange</h3>

<h2>Thematic conjugations</h2>
<p>Thematic verbs show i-umlaut in the second and third person singular as well as the second person plural in the indicative (except for the future) and the subjunctive. The present participle likewise shows this change.</p>

<h2>Resonantal conjugations</h2>
<h3>Transitive</h3>
<p>Resonantal verbs with a nasal-final stem must originally have had several deviating forms, which appear to have been analogised out entirely. The exception is the past participle, which is slightly different. °SEMMI°, which originally had a deviant subjunctive and imperative stem, generalised its indicative stem across the board (with the exception of the past participle as mentioned above). [i umlaut?]</p>

<p>We are unable to find or reconstruct any alpha resonantal intransitives.</p>
<h2>Vocalic conjugations</h2>
<p>In some forms of the vocalic conjugations, a technical hiatus was broken up by a prop glide depending on the vowel height of the second vowel. By §lang_2 times, however, the widespread distribution of /j/, which was part of a stem in all the factitives and denominatives, was reanalysed as part of the ending, effectively eliminating the usage of /w/ in these environments.</p>
<h3>Transitive</h3>
<p>In the preterite, we find two suffixes that alter the stem. In the first person singular, we find a nasalisation (and, as such, neutralisation of vowel length) of the vowel. However, as not all vowels could be nasalised, this often also involved a vowel shift:</p>
<table class="table w-auto table-sm">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Source vowel</th>
			<td>a ā</td>
			<td>e ē</td>
			<td>i ī</td>
			<td>o au</td>
			<td>u ou</td>
			<td>î ui</td>
			<td>ə ae</td>
			<td>ê oe</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Nasalised vowel</th>
			<td>ǫ</td>
			<td>ę</td>
			<td>ę</td>
			<td>ǫ</td>
			<td>ų</td>
			<td>ų</td>
			<td>ę</td>
			<td>ǫ</td>
		</tr>
	</body>
</table>
<p>The second person singular of the preterite is slightly harder. Where in §lang_1, the stem was either lengthened if a non-back vowel, or a suffix <i>*-ḫ</i> was appended otherwise, such predictability had been lost because of the vowel harmony. The lengthening was generalised. [i umlaut!]</p>

<h3>Intransitive</h3>
<p>Some minor restructuring ought to have taken place here. Whereas before, the separate subjunctive and imperative stem that also showed up in the first person indicative was limited to the subjunctive and imperative, with the general indicative stem being spread there.</p>
