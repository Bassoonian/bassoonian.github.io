<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<h3>Delta and Alpha</h3>
<p>As is the case for nouns, verbs were split into two subcategories that were originally based on the last vowel of their stem before vowel harmony took place.</p>
<h3>I-umlaut</h3>
<p>The stem alteration caused by i-umlaut was grammaticalised, although the exact occurrences vary between inflection paradigms. Generally, but not always, the alternate vowel is shared with the future stem.</p>
<h3>Past Stems</h3>
<p>The loss of short, unstressed, word-initial vowels after the shift to penultimate stress had thorough implications on the verbal system, as this also affected the augment. In many verbs that started with a consonant, the vowel was simply lost. When it started with a prevocalic voiced plosive, however, the previous allophone of intervocalic /b d g/ phonemicised, yielding initial /β ð ɣ/. This process was fully morphologised.</p>
<p>Besides these regular alterations, we also find an increase in irregular past stems. The stative preterites from §lang_1 and earlier had fully merged into the regular endings, also for intransitives, simply yielding an irregular past stem. Only rarely did this separate stem undergo the otherwise regular past mutation. Another source </p>
<p>Finally, past participles, which previously did not show the augment, now fully share their stem with the past forms.</p>
<h2>Transitive conjugations</h2>
<h3>Thematic</h3>
<p>Thematic transitives show i-umlaut in the second and third person singular as well as the second person plural in the indicative (except for the future) and the subjunctive. The present participle likewise shows this change.</p>
