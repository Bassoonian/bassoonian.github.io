<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<h3>Delta and Alpha</h3>
<p>As is the case for nouns, verbs were split into two subcategories that were originally based on the last vowel of their stem before vowel harmony took place.</p>
<h3>I-umlaut</h3>
<p>The stem alteration caused by i-umlaut was grammaticalised, although the exact occurrences vary between inflection paradigms. Generally, but not always, the alternate vowel is shared with the future stem.</p>
<h3>Past Stems</h3>
<p>The loss of short, unstressed, word-initial vowels after the shift to penultimate stress had thorough implications on the verbal system, as this also affected the augment. In many verbs that started with a consonant, the vowel was simply lost. When it started with a prevocalic voiced plosive, however, the previous allophone of intervocalic /b d g/ phonemicised, yielding initial /β ð ɣ/. This process was fully morphologised.</p>
<p>Besides these regular alterations, we also find an increase in irregular past stems. The stative preterites from §lang_1 and earlier had fully merged into the regular endings, also for intransitives, simply yielding an irregular past stem. Only rarely did this separate stem undergo the otherwise regular past mutation.</p>
<p>Finally, past participles, which previously did not show the augment, now fully share their stem with the past forms.</p>
<h3>Vowel-initial verbs</h3>
<p>TO CLEAN UP!</p>
<p>With §lang_2's stress dependent alteration of word-initial vowels, several oddities occurred in the verbal system. While in thematic verbs, their any loss of initial vowels was undone, the athematic verbs continued to show significant mutations. Luckily, these were fully morphologised and predictable. The distribution depended on vowel length and the first consonant (cluster) of the stem, while also only affecting monosyllabic stems. It is also noteworthy that the past stems, if irregular, do not show the following changes. The exact rules differ between thematics and athematics. We may summarise this process in three bullet points for athematics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the present stem starts on a vowel, an extra <i>j-</i> is epenthesised in the past.</li>
	<ul><li>If this initial vowel is followed by a consonant (cluster) that would be a legal onset, the initial vowel is deleted in the future forms;</li></ul>
	<li>If the present stem starts on a sequence of <i>j-</i> and a vowel, the glide is lost in future forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are easily explainable diachronically. In monosyllabic stems, the past forms would have had a long initial vowel because of the augment, which subsequently broke, while the loss of this initial short vowel in the future forms would likewise be regular. The main source of stems on <i>jV-</i> in monosyllables comes from original long vowels, which would not have a different vowel because of the augment, and would have been shortened in all future forms before the vowel breaking.</p>
<p>A similar process happened to polysyllabic stems. Stems on a short vowel with a cluster that could not function as onset remained the same, while stems on a long vowel were regularly shortened. Original polysyllabic stems on a short vowel and a cluster that is a legal onset regularly lost this vowel; it is likely that originally, the past forms retained a short version of this vowel, but this must have been analogised out early enough - in fact, these past stems show the regular consonant application discussed above if applicable, which must be a result of later analogy.</p>
<h2>Thematic conjugations</h2>
<p>Thematic verbs show i-umlaut in the second and third person singular as well as the second person plural in the indicative (except for the future) and the subjunctive. The present participle likewise shows this change.</p>
<h3>Transitive</h3>

<h2>Resonantal conjugations</h2>
<p>Resonantal verbs with a nasal-final stem must originally have had several deviating forms, which appear to have been analogised out entirely. The exception is the past participle, which is slightly different. While resonantal conjugations presumably also had a somewhat set pattern on when stems showed i-umlaut and when they didn't, this was eventually somewhat generalised depending on the transitivty.</p>
<h3>Transitive</h3>
<p>The verb °SEMMI°, which originally had a deviant subjunctive and imperative stem, generalised its indicative stem across the board. Transitive resonantal verbs generalised the i-umlaut stem across the board except for future forms; it is likely that this was originally limited to the indicative and subjunctive present/non-past and preterite/past as well as the present participle, but subsequently spread further. This yields up to three stems in total: a main stem, a possibly deviating future stem, and a possibly deviating stem for past participles.</p>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-MI_RES_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-MI_RES_ALPH||
<h3>Intransitive</h3>
<p>The intransitive resonantal conjugation generalised i-umlaut for the subjunctive stems only. This likewise yelds up to three stems in total, albeit distributed differently: a main stem, a possibly deviating subjunctive stem, and a possibly deviating stem for past participles.</p>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-OR_RES_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
<p>We are unable to find or reconstruct any alpha resonantal intransitives.</p>
<h2>Vocalic conjugations</h2>
<p>In some forms of the vocalic conjugations, a technical hiatus was broken up by a prop glide depending on the vowel height of the second vowel. By §lang_2 times, however, the widespread distribution of /j/, which was part of a stem in all the factitives and denominatives, was reanalysed as part of the ending, effectively eliminating the usage of /w/ in these environments. This also affected the few forms which did originally have /w/ as part of their stem.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the subjunctive forms of the alpha forms here are identical to the delta forms. This is unexpected. The option posited most often is the fact most verbs had subjunctive stems ending on a diphthong that induced delta colouring onto suffixes. This would then have spread to the few verbs which did show alpha colouring in the subjunctive.</p>
<h3>Transitive</h3>
<p>In the preterite, we find two suffixes that alter the stem. In the first person singular, we find a nasalisation (and, as such, neutralisation of vowel length) of the vowel. However, as not all vowels could be nasalised, this often also involved a vowel shift:</p>
<table class="table w-auto table-sm">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Source vowel</th>
			<td>a ā</td>
			<td>e ē</td>
			<td>i ī</td>
			<td>o au</td>
			<td>u ou</td>
			<td>î ui</td>
			<td>ə ae</td>
			<td>ê oe</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Nasalised vowel</th>
			<td>ǫ</td>
			<td>ę</td>
			<td>ę</td>
			<td>ǫ</td>
			<td>ų</td>
			<td>ų</td>
			<td>ę</td>
			<td>ǫ</td>
		</tr>
	</body>
</table>
<p>The second person singular of the preterite is significantly easier. Where in §lang_1, the stem was either lengthened if a non-back vowel, or a suffix <i>*-ḫ</i> was appended otherwise, such predictability had been lost because of the vowel harmony. The lengthening was generalised.</p>
<p>As was the case for transitive resonantal verbs, i-umlaut affected all forms - even the future forms in vocalics, however. This yielded three stems: an indicative stem, a possibly deviating future stem, and a distinct stem for subjunctives and imperatives.</p>

<h3>Intransitive</h3>
<p>Some minor restructuring ought to have taken place here. Whereas before, the separate subjunctive and imperative stem that also showed up in the first person indicative was limited to the subjunctive and imperative, with the general indicative stem having spread there. Again, like the intransitive resonantals, i-umlaut affected the subjunctive first and foremost. As for the transitives, the future forms were affected too.</p>
