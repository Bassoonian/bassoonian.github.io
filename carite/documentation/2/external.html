<h2>Latin</h2>
<p>Being under Roman rule, it is only natural §lang_2 adopted numerous words from Latin. By 350 AD, however, the Latin that was spoken was no longer the classical Latin most are used to. While it had not strayed too far yet, some important changes had started taking place, all of which are reflected in the loans and may be used to date when the loaning process took place.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>The confusion between Latin <<b>> and <<v>> had already started by this point, especially intervocalically. In almost all Latin loans, we find /v/ for initial <<v>>, eg. °VELUMSAIL° for lat@vēlum, as well as intervocalic <<b>>, eg. °FLATBREAD° from lat@lībum; one of the exceptions is °VIRIDIA° from lat@virdia, which with its << <span class="smallcapsroman">B</span> >> must postdate the phonemicisation of /β/. [in other positions?] Since caritologists generally posit a phonemic status of /β/ in §lang_2, being contrastive with /b v/ initially and /b/ intervocalically, it is generally assumed that these words were loaned relatively early. Latin /kʷ/ <<qu>> was loaned as §lang_2 /kw/ with lat@quālum yielding °KWAULU°. </p>
