<h2>Latin</h2>
<p>Being under Roman rule, it is only natural §lang_2 adopted numerous words from Latin. By 350 AD, however, the Latin that was spoken was no longer the classical Latin most are used to. While it had not strayed too far yet, some important changes had started taking place, all of which are reflected in the loans and may be used to date when the loaning process took place.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>The confusion between Latin <<b>> and <<v>> had already started by this point, especially intervocalically. In almost all Latin loans, we find /v/ for initial <<v>>, eg. °VELUMSAIL° for lat@vēlum, as well as intervocalic <<b>>, eg. °FLATBREAD° from lat@lībum; one of the exceptions is °VIRIDIA° from lat@virdia, which with its << <span class="smallcapsroman">B</span> >> must postdate the phonemicisation of /β/. Since Caritologists generally posit a phonemic status of /β/ in §lang_2, being contrastive with /b v/ initially and /b/ intervocalically, it is generally assumed that these words were loaned relatively early. Latin /kʷ/ <<qu>> was loaned as §lang_2 /kw/ with lat@quālum yielding °KWAULU°. </p>
<p>Some early traces of palatalisation of Vulgar Latin may likewise be observed. More specifically, we find the palatalisation and merger of Latin /j dj gj/, as well as palatalisation of the cluster /tj/, with /kj/ notably not being represented yet. For example, lat@odium surfaces as °ODIUMHATE° with the cluster /dz/, featuring the marginal phoneme /z/, being indicative of the palatalisation, while the month March from lat@mārtius surfaces as °MARCH°. Initially, it is unclear if the affricate was loaned as the cluster /dz/ or as the bare fricative /z/ as the orthography is identical and the cluster is reduced to a bare fricative early in §lang_3 times. The general consensus was that it was simply /z/, citing the illegality of /ts/ as initial cluster.</p>
<p>The intervocalic spirantisation, voicing and degemination of plosives we associate with Vulgar Latin must have been incomplete or not yet reached the Carite area at the time of §lang_2; after all, this is frequently dated only to the 5th century, at least in Gaul. Likewise, the palatalisation of velars before front vowels, rather than when directly preceding /j/, only took place after §lang_2 times.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>One of the key evolutions from Latin to the Romance languages was the collapse of the vowel system depending on the region. This was clearly a somewhat gradual process that is also significantly hard to date, but we find early traces already in §lang_2 times. It is worth noting that vowel length was in fact retained, at least until the final loans in §lang_2 times, despite quality having started to shift somewhat.</p>
<p>The vulgar pronunciation of Latin /i/, which was merging or had already merged into [e], frequently surfaces as /e/ in Carite. It is likely that, at least relating to the Latin spoken in the Carite area, short /e/ was pronounced more similarly to [æ] rather than [ɛ], with this vowel often being loaned as /æ/. A good example is °EMERALD° from lat@smeralda with Latin /e/ being reflected as Carite /æ/ and the initial /e/ reflecting a Vulgar Latin /i/. While in the rest of Carite history, we will find /æ/ not just written as <<e>> but also surfacing as /e/ by §lang_4 times, °DONKEY° provides a nice counterexample as its /æ/ was lengthened and ends up yielding a different outcome. These changes are visible not in the earliest loans, but in most regardless. Slightly later, although unclear when, we also find a merger of short /u/ into [o], eg. °CULTRUM° from lat@culter. While short [o] may have been pronounced [ɔ], this distinction was lost when loaned into Carite as seen in °TRIPE° from lat@omāsum. While all loans on <<-us>> or <<-um>> borrowed after the vowel harmony are considered to be delta as such - even if the actual realisation was no longer [u] in Latin - this correlation appears to have been lost in the latest loans, with words such as °MIRROR° from lat@speculum being categorised wherever would seem most appropriate based on the final vowel of the root.</p>
<p>The typical Romance change of prosthesis before initial /sC/ is apparent loans °EMERALD° from lat@smeralda. Likewise, we find the familiar syncope in words such as °VIRIDIA°. While °AUGUST° is a somewhat special case since it contains the Latin diphthong /au/, which was noteworthily resistant to monophthongisation, it features /o/ regardless. It is likely this word was borrowed at a time Carite still possessed its diphthongs, in which case it would have monophthongised in Carite itself.</p>
