<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<p>Several notable phonological developments, such as vowel harmony and Exon's Law, had a significant on nominal morphology. For example, all paradigms were split into two: one being referred to as delta-variants (δ), which often (but not always) features high vowels, and the other being referred to as alpha-variantst (α), which likewise primarily features non-high vowels. Whether delta- or alpha-variants are the most common subparadigm within the split depends on the paradigm. For example, thematic feminines almost exclusively feature alpha-variants - the result of the prior a-umlaut, which lowered many high vowels - while iotic nominals almost exclusively feature delta-variants - the result of a prior i-umlaut, which fronted many vowels. We also find the loss of the instrumental as a distinct case, as well as the remodeling of nasal stems, which show a merger into iotics for masculine nouns and a merger into thematics for neuter nouns. The conjunctive forms remain distinctive and grammatical; however, their distinctiveness was greatly reduced: the nominative forms were usurped by the accusative forms, while the dative forms were generalised to all oblique cases.</p>

<h3>Feminine</h3>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly due to their previous classification as a-stems - a term avoided in §lang_2 studies due to possible confusion with the alpha variants - a significant portion of the feminine forms were affected by a-umlaut, which was subsequently generalised across the paradigm. The few expected oddities, such as an i-umlaut in the locative singular and lack of umlaut in the genitive plural, are easily explainable. Significantly more curious, however, is the spread of a-umlaut forms to the conjunctive paradigm, which - even before the loss of distinctiveness - would not have induced umlaut anywhere. This is easily explainable considering the primary forms were used far more often than the conjunctives.</p>

<h3>Neuter</h3>
<p>While neuters presumably had a-umlaut induced in the nominative and accusative plural, albeit only in the primary and not in the conjunctive forms, this must have been analogised away by the first attestations.</p>

<h3>Adjectival</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
<p>Thematic delta adjectives in §lang_2 sometimes featured a stem alteration between masculine/neuter and feminine; as explained above, this was the result of a-umlaut being generalised for all feminine forms. In almost all cases, this alteration is etymological - in a few cases, however, it is analogical. It is worth noting these alterations were limited to adjectives with a monosyllabic stem.</p>
<p>The distinction between substantival and adjectival inflections for delta thematics has diminished even further since §lang_1 times, with the only distinction being the dative singular in the masculine and neuter forms; the feminine inflects identically for both substantival and adjectival.</p>

<h4>Alpha</h4>
<p>The distinction between substantival and adjectival inflection is slightly more present for alpha thematics. As in the delta adjectives, we find a different vowel in the dative singular for masculine and neuter forms. In the locative singular of the feminines, we likewise find a different suffix. In the genitive plural of all three forms, we find a deviating vowel as well.</p>
