<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<p>Several notable phonological developments, such as vowel harmony and Exon's Law, had a significant on nominal morphology. For example, all paradigms were split into two: one being referred to as delta-variants (δ), which often (but not always) features high vowels, and the other being referred to as alpha-variantst (α), which likewise primarily features non-high vowels. Whether delta- or alpha-variants are the most common subparadigm within the split depends on the paradigm. For example, thematic feminines almost exclusively feature alpha-variants - the result of the prior a-umlaut, which lowered many high vowels - while iotic nominals almost exclusively feature delta-variants - the result of a prior i-umlaut, which fronted many vowels. We also find the loss of the instrumental as a distinct case, as well as the remodeling of nasal stems, which show a merger into iotics for masculine nouns and a merger into thematics for neuter nouns. The conjunctive forms remain distinctive and grammatical; however, their distinctiveness was greatly reduced: the nominative forms were usurped by the accusative forms, while the dative forms were generalised to all oblique cases.</p>
<h2>Thematic Nominals</h2>
<h3>Masculine</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-OS_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-OS_UNSTRESSED_ALPH||
<h3>Feminine</h3>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly due to their previous classification as a-stems - a term avoided in §lang_2 studies due to possible confusion with the alpha variants - a significant portion of the feminine forms were affected by a-umlaut, which was subsequently generalised across the paradigm. The few expected oddities, such as an i-umlaut in the locative singular and lack of umlaut in the genitive plural, are easily explainable. Significantly more curious, however, is the spread of a-umlaut forms to the conjunctive paradigm, which - even before the loss of distinctiveness - would not have induced umlaut anywhere. This is easily explainable considering the primary forms were used far more often than the conjunctives.</p>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-AA_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-AA_UNSTRESSED_ALPH||
<h3>Neuter</h3>
<p>While neuters presumably had a-umlaut induced in the nominative and accusative plural, albeit only in the primary and not in the conjunctive forms, this must have been analogised away by the first attestations.</p>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-OM_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-OM_UNSTRESSED_ALPH||
<h3>Adjectival</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_DEF||
<p>Thematic delta adjectives in §lang_2 sometimes featured a stem alteration between masculine/neuter and feminine; as explained above, this was the result of a-umlaut being generalised for all feminine forms. In almost all cases, this alteration is etymological - in a few cases, however, it is analogical. It is worth noting these alterations were limited to adjectives with a monosyllabic stem.</p>
<p>The distinction between substantival and adjectival inflections for delta thematics has diminished even further since §lang_1 times, with the only distinction being the dative singular in the masculine and neuter forms; the feminine inflects identically for both substantival and adjectival.</p>
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_ALPH||
<p>The distinction between substantival and adjectival inflection is slightly more present for alpha thematics. As in the delta adjectives, we find a different vowel in the dative singular for masculine and neuter forms. In the locative singular of the feminines, we likewise find a different suffix. In the genitive plural of all three forms, we find a deviating vowel as well.</p>
<h2>Iotic Nominals</h2>
<h3>Masculine</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-IS_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-IS_UNSTRESSED_ALPH||
<h3>Feminine</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-II_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-II_UNSTRESSED_ALPH||
<h3>Neuter</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-I_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-I_UNSTRESSED_ALPH||
<h3>Adjectival</h3>
<p>Interestingly, the iotic adjectives do not appear to make any distinction between delta and alpha. The reason is simple: none of their suffixes were affected by vowel harmony from a preceding stem.</p>
||TABLE-ADJ_I_STRESSED||
<p>The adjectival inflection of iotics is formally identical to the delta subparadigms.</p>
<h2>Acrostatic Nominals</h2>
<p>The medial <i>*-es-</i> found in all forms except for nominative and accusative singular was generalised across the paradigm. It is unknown if this occurred before or after i-umlaut, as it is likely the umlaut would have been regularised as well.</p>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-ESOS_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-ESOS_UNSTRESSED_ALPH||
<h2>Degrees of comparison</h2>
<h3>Comparative</h3>
||TABLE-COMPARATIVE||
<p>Due to its unique inflection pattern, the comparative degree does not distinguish between adjectival and substantival usage.</p>
<h3>Superlative</h3>
||TABLE-SUPERLATIVE||
<p>Superlatives always took delta suffixes. Besides the adjectival table presented above, superlatives could also take thematic substantival endings.</p>
<h2>Numerals</h2>
<h3>One</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-NUM_ONE||</div>
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The numeral for one cleanly follows a thematic inflection with a single caveat: it does not decline like an adjective.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<h3>Two</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The irregular inflection of the numeral for two remains. The coalescence of <i>*dw</i> to <i>*b</i>, which was limited to environments with a front vowel, presumably orginally only affected half the paradigm, with the generalisation of this stem having been the result of analogy.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-NUM_TWO||</div>
	</div>
</div>
<h3>Three</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-NUM_THREE||</div>
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>As in §lang_0, the reconstructed inflection table for the numeral for three is closely related to the iotic adjectives. However, we find several long vowels that were shortened in polysyllabic adjectives.</p>

<!-- <h2>Pronouns</h2>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<h4>First and second</h4>
<p>While the first and second pronouns appear to have made a distinction between tonic and atonic forms before, the atonic forms seem to have been lost by §lang_2 times, being entirely usurped by the tonic forms.</p>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-6">
			<p>In the first person pronouns, we find two main developments, both in the plural forms. First of all, all forms on <i>*in-</i> appear to have been outright replaced by the stems on <i>*a-</i>. Additionally, the initial nasal of the atonic forms seems to have spread to the tonic forms. It is unclear which development took place first - perhaps the intrusion of the initial nasal motivated the dissimilatory replacement of the old forms on <i>*in-</i>.</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-6">||TABLE-PRON_PERS_2||</div>
		<div class="col-6">
			<p>While the first person plural pronouns underwent generalisation of one of the tonic forms, no such analogy was necessary for the second person pronouns, which did not undergo any sort of alteration. However, the initial <i>*w</i> - eventually <i>*ḫ</i> - did spread from the atonic forms to the tonic forms.</p>
