<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<p>Several notable phonological developments, such as vowel harmony and Exon's Law, had a significant on nominal morphology. For example, all paradigms were split into two: one being referred to as delta-variants (δ), which often (but not always) features high vowels, and the other being referred to as alpha-variantst (α), which likewise primarily features non-high vowels. Whether delta- or alpha-variants are the most common subparadigm within the split depends on the paradigm. For example, thematic feminines almost exclusively feature alpha-variants - the result of the prior a-umlaut, which lowered many high vowels - while iotic nominals almost exclusively feature delta-variants - the result of a prior i-umlaut, which fronted many vowels. It is worth noting that in several cases, in paradigms with minimal differences between delta and alpha forms, one was generalised relatively early on. Within this schism, we also find another (albeit relatively rare) Exon's variant, which features minor differences as a result of the syncope, with a couple of nouns showing stem alterations.</p>
<p>We also find the loss of the instrumental as a distinct case, as well as the remodeling of nasal stems, which show a merger into iotics for masculine nouns and a merger into thematics for neuter nouns. The conjunctive forms remain distinctive and grammatical; however, their distinctiveness was greatly reduced: the nominative forms were usurped by the accusative forms, while the dative forms were generalised to all oblique cases.</p>
<p>In all feminine forms, we find an irregular shortening of the first vowel in the dative and locative plural suffixes (as well as the genitive plural for conjunctives). This must have happened through analogy with the masculine and neuter forms, which have a short vowel. It is likely that this occurred before Exon's law, although it would not be impossible for it to have been reapplied analogically after.</p>

<h3>Feminine</h3>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly due to their previous classification as a-stems - a term avoided in §lang_2 studies due to possible confusion with the alpha variants - a significant portion of the feminine forms were affected by a-umlaut, which was subsequently generalised across the paradigm. The few expected oddities, such as an i-umlaut in the locative singular and lack of umlaut in the genitive plural, are easily explainable. Significantly more curious, however, is the spread of a-umlaut forms to the conjunctive paradigm, which - even before the loss of distinctiveness - would not have induced umlaut anywhere. This is easily explainable considering the primary forms were used far more often than the conjunctives.</p>

<h3>Neuter</h3>
<p>While neuters presumably had a-umlaut induced in the nominative and accusative plural, albeit only in the primary and not in the conjunctive forms, this must have been analogised away by the first attestations.</p>

<h3>Adjectival</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_DEF||
<p>Thematic delta adjectives in §lang_2 sometimes featured a stem alteration between masculine/neuter and feminine; as explained above, this was the result of a-umlaut being generalised for all feminine forms. In almost all cases, this alteration is etymological - in a few cases, however, it is analogical. It is worth noting these alterations were generally, but not always, limited to adjectives with a monosyllabic stem.</p>
<p>The distinction between substantival and adjectival inflections for delta thematics has diminished even further since §lang_1 times, with the only distinction being the dative singular in the masculine and neuter forms; the feminine inflects identically for both substantival and adjectival.</p>
<h4>Alpha</h4>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_ALPH||
<p>The distinction between substantival and adjectival inflection is slightly more present for alpha thematics. As in the delta adjectives, we find a different vowel in the dative singular for masculine and neuter forms. In the locative singular of the feminines, we likewise find a different suffix. In the genitive plural of all three forms, we find a deviating vowel as well.</p>
<h2>Iotic Nominals</h2>
<p>Of the iotic nominals, only the masculine forms appear distinguish between delta and alpha. It is assumed that separate alpha forms originally existed for feminines and neuters, although the only expected difference would be the primary genitive plural. As such, it is evident that the generalisation of the delta forms - which were identical to the adjectival suffixes, as mentioned below - was rather straightforward.</p>

<h3>Adjectival</h3>
<p>Interestingly, the iotic adjectives do not appear to make any distinction between delta and alpha. The reason is simple: none of their suffixes were affected by vowel harmony from a preceding stem.</p>
||TABLE-ADJ_I_STRESSED||
<p>The adjectival inflection of iotics is formally identical to the delta subparadigms.</p>
<h2>Acrostatic Nominals</h2>
<p>The medial <i>*-es-</i> found in all forms except for nominative and accusative singular was generalised across the paradigm. It is unknown if this occurred before or after i-umlaut, as it is likely the umlaut would have been regularised as well.</p>

<h2>Degrees of comparison</h2>
<p>With both comparatives and superlatives inducing i-umlaut, thematic adjectives occasionally showed stem alteration if in another degree than the positive. This alteration affected the stem regardless of gender, leading to some adjectives having three distinct stems (and some not undergoing any alteration at all). Iotic adjectives, on the other hand, never showed this alteration due to already having been affected by i-umlaut in their positive stem.</p>
<h3>Comparative</h3>
<p>Due to its unique inflection pattern, the comparative degree does not distinguish between adjectival and substantival usage. However, the suffixes can vary wildly due to the separation of delta and alpha variants, as well as the added possibility of being an Exon variant. Luckily, the choice of comparative suffixes was perfectly predictable from the inflection paradigm of the positive adjective. While iotic adjectives are assumed to originally have made a distinction between delta and alpha comparatives, this distinction must have been levelled out gradually due to all iotic positive adjectives declining as if they were delta.</p>

<h2>Pronouns</h2>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<h4>First and second</h4>
<p>While the first and second pronouns appear to have made a distinction between tonic and atonic forms before, the atonic forms seem to have been lost by §lang_2 times, being entirely usurped by the tonic forms. It is worth noting they retain full distinction of cases in the conjunctive forms too.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, the pronominal inflection must have merged into the substantival thematic inflection bar the nominative and accusative neuter singular. Deviating forms can clearly be found in the conjunctives, where the typical mergers did not occur.</p>
