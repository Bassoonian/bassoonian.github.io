<h1>Orthography</h1>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the orthography of §lang_2 was created under strong influence of Latin - noteworthily, the post-classical Latin spoken around 350 in the Iberian Peninsula. It is worth noting we may make a distinction in §lang_2 orthography depending on if we use the caritological notation or if we purely analyse the tendencies found in the attestations.</p>
<h2>Consonants</h2>
<p>The notation of consonants was relatively straightforward, with the nasals /m n/ simply being represented as <<m n>>, respectvely. The tenuis plosives /p b t d k g/ were conveyed as <<p b t d c g>>. /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ were often written as <<ph th ch>>, but in some cases simply as <<p t c>>; caritological usage generalises the former. The voiced fricatives /ð ɣ/, which only contrasted with the voiced plosives word-initially, were written simply as <<d g>>, with the word-initial instances being marked with an underdot, i.e. <<ḍ ġ>>. The word-initial phoneme /β/ was consistently conveyed using <<v>> while the intervocalic realisation of /b/, [β], was written both as <<b>> and <<v>> - after all, the partial neutralisation of these two sounds in Latin was already taking place. In the modernised version, the intervocalic sound is simply represented as <<b>> with <<ḅ>> appearing word-initially. The cluster /kw/ was written as <<qu>>. Before /u/, it seems to be simply written as <<q>>, however. The labiodental fricatives /f v/ were conveyed as <<ff f>>, respectively, while /s/ was simply written as <<s>>. /h/, which was lost in Late Latin but phonemic in §lang_2, was often written as <<h>>, although misspellings are plenty with the glyph often missing or erroneously being added through hypercorrection. The rhotics /r ʁ/ were not distinguished and were both conveyed using <<r>>, although the modernised spellings use a háček, i.e. <<ř>>. The lateral /l/ was evidently written as <<l>>. Finally, the glides /w j/ were conveyed using their vocalic equivalents <<v i>>, although the latter is frequently written as <<j>> in modernised editions. /ks/ is written as <<x>> and geminates have their glyph doubled.</p>
<h2>Vowels</h2>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, §lang_2's vowel inventory was not very compatible with Latin's, especially since the latter's was reduced even further post-classically. The short standard five vowels /a e i o u/ were simply written as such, i.e. <<a e i o u>>. The first three did not distinguish length when it came to their long equivalents, /aː eː iː/, although the modernised spelling employs a macron, i.e. <<ā ē ī>>. The long back vowels were represented as if they were a diphthong through <<au ou>> for /oː uː/, respectively. /æ ø y/ were not distinguished properly in §lang_2 times, being written as <<e e i>>, respectively. Modernisation employs a circumflex for /ø y/, i.e. <<ê î>>, as it indicates rounding of <<e i>> /e i/. /æ/ is frequently rendered as <<ə>> in modern settings. The long equivalents of these three vowels, i.e. /æː øː yː/, were conveyed using the dedicated digraphs <<ae oe ui>>. The nasal vowels /ẽ õ ũ/ were simply written as <<e o u>>, although they are marked with an ogonek in modern usage, i.e. <<ę ǫ ų>>. It is worth noting that, like in modernised Latin, <<u>> was actually written as <<v>> in (post-)classical times.</p>
