<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Carite mythology has been extensively researched. A vast amount of inscriptions involve snippets of myths and some have been documented in other languages; an example includes a part of ??? being explained in vast detail in Tacitus' ???. Due to the limited scope of the Carite people, mythology was considered to be a vital part of their culture and identity and was held dearly. Nonetheless, due to extensive contact with other peoples and their religious beliefs, a significant portion of Carite mythology evolved over time, often incorporating foreign elements or replacing whole sections altogether. By the time of the Carite kingdom in the 12th century, Carite paganism flourished in stark contrast with the surrounding highly Christian kingdoms. The main written literature on the Carite pantheon and mythology dates from the existence of the kingdom. It is worth noting that several myths appear both in older inscriptions and in the monarchic attestations with actions and involved characters of not matching at all due to the influence of other religions (including Christianity) on the mythology. As such, this chapter deals with the Carite mythology as established in medieval times.</p>
<h2>Worldview</h2>
<h3>Underworld</h3>
<p>The underworld, often but not always referred to as the °EMOUNO°, was the realm where the dead resided. It was widely perceived to be situated below the living world and the deceased were traditionally buried. We find several key Indo-European traces in the rituals surrounding the dead. One is the accompaniment of the corpse with some sort of currency. While we find descriptions of the afterlife referring to a body of water - more precisely, the moat the size of a sea - we find no references or implications of any sort of ferryman or any other equivalent of for example grc@Χάρων=Khárōn and as such, the exact purpose of this monetary gift is unknown. As in Zoroastrian doctrine and Germanic mythology, there is also a mention of a bridge, although it is unsure if this is used metaphorically in Carite mythology or if it does indeed describe the path to cross the moat. Inside, we find word of a large structure, variously referred to as a palace or a castle, with a gate that prevents the alive from entering and the dead from leaving. A single document refers to a single judge being in control of the gates, although further elaboration does not exist. Discussed in greater detail is the infernal dog, °KWONIS°. Little is said about his exact appearance besides his intimidating size, and as such it is unsure if the dog possessed typical Indo-European characteristics such as multiple heads or eyes. Its behaviour, however, is described as fierce, and the canine guardian of the underworld is said to never sleep, to bark fiercely to whoever passes by and to devour those attempting to escape.</p>
<p>Residing in the underworld and watching over the dead was °HADES°.</p>
<!-- it's also a meadow and "the land of the fathers", day of the dead as a ritual-->
<h2>Deities</h2>
<p>Many Carite deities are related, as shown in the following family tree:</p>
||DEITYTREE||
<h3>Major deities</h3>
<h4>€SUNGOD€</h4>
<p><b>°SUNGOD°</b> is the god of the war and, secondarily, the sun and also functions as the pantheon's allfather after the theomachy depicted in the foundation war. His association with the sun appears to have been mostly historical - after all, he is married to the moon goddess and his name is clearly derived from pie@sóh₂wl̥ - and the important trait of seeing everything appears to have been inherited by his daughter €LEXY€. It is likely that his association with war predates his equation to lat@Mārs, although this is impossible to ascertain.</p>
<p>Many features that originally belonged to €SKYDADDY€ appear to have been adopted by €SUNGOD€ following his ascent to the throne. For example, he is referred to as "father" and the all-seeing, all-knowing feature present in his daughter €LEXY€ were presumably transferred onto €SUNGOD€ first. The divine twins (see below) were likewise transferred to be his children instead.</p>
<h4>€MOONGOD€</h4>
<p><b>°MOONGOD°</b> is the goddess of the moon, healing and the sea. It is very likely she was also worshipped as a goddess of hunting - this is in all likelihood a feature she gained due to her equation to lat@Diāna; the emblem of chastity associated with her is likewise shared with Diāna, but maybe significantly older. The historical link between the moon and the sea is obvious, while the healing aspect may be original or be due to Christian influence (cf. baptism). The notion that magic herbs may only be gathered in moonlight may also be of importance here.</p>
<p>As the consort of €SUNGOD€, €MOONGOD€ appears to have inherited the title "mother" from €EARTHMUMMY€ following the foundation war. However, most of her non-moon traits may not be related to this inheritance.</p>
<h4>€PERKUNAS€</h4>
<p><b>°PERKUNAS°</b> is the god of thunder, smiths, law and justice. Despite not being head of the pantheon, he very prevalently appears in a great amount of myths and plays a key role in many of the major stories; this may be attributed to his identity being a conflation of multiple older deities as well as his equation to lat@Iuppiter in later times. While details of his depiction vary, he is generally considered to be a middle aged man with a long beard. He stands out by only having a right arm (the loss of his left arm plays a pivotal role in the Discovery of Immortality).</p>
<p>€PERKUNAS€ appears to primarily be a conflation of two Indo-European deities: the god of thunder and the god of smiths. As the deity of thunder, he is painted as the protector of both gods and humans against evil. His association with oak trees, which he occasionally smites, is also of importance here and may have helped him get more important within the pantheon over time. His tendency to ride a car drawn by two goats, with the rumbling of his vehicle being the thunder, also appears to be inherited, just like his beard.</p>
<p>When it comes to his smith god heritage, a key part is his involvement in the creation of €SKYDADDY€'s weapon as well as his involvement in the immortals' drinking (see the Discovery of Immortality). If one considers the loss of his left arm as laming, we may also find parallels with grc@Ἥφαιστος=Hḗphaistos and the Germanic Wayland, though this may be a coincidence.</p>
<p>€PERKUNAS€'s signature hammer, the °LEGHAMMER°, is presumably the result of his storm god heritage (the lightning-shaped handle also points towards this) but may additionally be inforced by his status as the smith god, using it both for warfare and the crafting of weapons.</p>
<p>Besides his main occupation being the god of thunder and smiths, €PERKUNAS€ also appears to have some role when it comes to law and justice. For this reason, he is widely considered to also inherit Dumézil's First Function (juridical). The loss of his left arm would also reflect this inheritance.</p>
<h4>€AURORA€</h4>
<p><b>°AURORA°</b></p>
<h4>€HADES€</h4>
<p><b>°HADES°</b> is the god of death. Alongside his wife, €DEATHGODDESS€, and their son, €DIRVINI€, he rules the underworld.</p>
<h4>€PROINA€</h4>
<p><b>°PROINA°</b></p>
<h4>€LEXY€</h4>
<p><b>°LEXY°</b> is the goddess of magic and mysticism. Without any clear other Indo-European parallels, it is likely she originated in a substrate culture before taking over several key functions from her father €SUNGOD€. Like her brother €PERKUNAS€ inherits Dumézil's First Function (juridical), she is considered to inherit his other First Function (sacred). Indeed, she associated with the loss of vision (her Indo-European cognate deities lost a single eye instead) and may only see from the sun, which functions as her eye; indeed, when €SUNGOD€ perishes in the final battle, she loses all of her vision. She is the mother of €DEATHGODDESS€.</p>
<h3>Minor deities</h3>
<h4>€SKYDADDY€</h4>
<p><b>°SKYDADDY°</b> is the old god of the sky and forms a couple with °EARTHMUMMY°. Originally the head of the divine realm, his position was taken over by €SUNGOD€. Many of the original traits of the original heavenly father, <i>*Dyḗws Ph₂tḗr</i>, are no longer reflected in him and have presumably been taken over by the other gods, most importantly by €SUNGOD€. His limited scope as god of the sky presumably did not particularly aid with his survival, and in the last attestations, he is nothing but a relic, being only referred to unambiguously in the cosmogeny and foundation war myths. Nonetheless, his name and epiphets cleanly reflect this Indo-European origin.</p>
<h4>€EARTHMUMMY€</h4>
<p><b>°EARTHMUMMY°</b> is the old goddess of the earth and agriculture. She is variably depicted as being €SKYDADDY€'s wife or consort, notably being the mother of °AURORA°. Like her husband, her motherly title was inherited by €MOONGOD€ instead.</p>
<h4>€HORSETWIN1€ & €HORSETWIN2€</h4>
<p>From an Indo-European point of view, we would expect the divine twins to be children of €SKYDADDY€. </p>
<h4>€IGNIS€</h4>
<p><b>°IGNIS°</b> is the god of fire. The son of the divine twins and €AURORA€, he came into being destined to overthrow €SUNGOD€ and provide access to the throne but the plan was foiled by €LEXY€, who saw their intentions and exiled him underwater, tasked to protect the €BLOODSERP€ at all costs. When €SUNGOD€ falls in the final battle, he rises from the sea to represent and defend his faction, fulfilling his destiny.</p>
<p>Despite being represented as an infinitely powerful deity, his exile to underwater means his role is incredibly minor. He most likely originated from the story of the fire in the waters which was conflated with the pivotal role in the final battle due to the importance of a grandson or nephew. Some have argued that €SUNGOD€'s survival as allfather thanks to his unmarried daughter reflects the thematics of the king and the virgin, although this is widely contested as the virgin providing offspring is missing. It is through his role in the final battle that he is sometimes equated to Jesus Christ as the return of both figures meant the endtime was imminent.</p>
<h4>€PAN€</h4>
<p><b>°PAN°</b> is the god of cattle, wayfarers and commerce. He clearly continues the deity also reflected in grc@Πάν=Pán and san@पूषन्=Pūṣan and, in Carite, is a son of €PERKUNAS€ and €PROINA€. Key features include a bushy beard and keen sight, as well as a clear affinity with goats in particular. Corresponding to the Sanskrit goats that pull the car and the Greek goat legs, €PAN€ rides his own horse, named [???], and is described as jumping from mountaintop to mountaintop. The combination of the pastoral and traveling aspects clearly gives way to a secondary commercial function, which led to the later equation with lat@Mercurius. Other functions of his include leading the dead to the afterlife and leading the bride to the groom. Unlike the other deities, €PAN€ did not live in the divine realm; rather, he was stationed on the mortal plane, where he watched out over humans. He is a major figure in the acquisition of fire.</p>
<h4>€NARBO€</h4>
<p><b>°NARBO°</b> is the goddess of rivers. Like €IGNIS€, she is a child of the divine twins and €AURORA€. Originally functioning as a mere river goddess, who was venerated in function of fertility and secondarily luck and health, she adopted several traits originally native to her fathers, which lost importance over the course of history. More specifically, she is a rescuer who comes to aid to those in need, and she rides a car that comes from the river. Likewise, her white horse was born in the water. [insert native stuff]</p>
<h4>€DEATHGODDESS€</h4>
<p>The daughter of €LEXY€ and one of her mortal lovers, <b>°DEATHGODDESS°</b> was originally a demigoddess. Employed as a seer from an early age, she was eventually seduced by €HADES€. When she and their unborn child, €DIRVINI€ tragically died during childbirth, €HADES€ revived them, although they could only live in the underworld. She was revered as a patron (demi)goddess of those who died during childbirth. Her secondary relation to nature presumably came into being due to her equation with grc@Περσεφόνη=Persephónē and lat@Prōserpina, but it may also have been at play earlier.</p>
<h4>€DIRVINI€</h4>
<p><b>°DIRVINI°</b> was the undead child of €HADES€ and €DEATHGODDESS€. He functioned as the judge at the gates of the underworld, but also collected the souls from the dead. He is described as never aging, being the size of a toddler or small child, and has features both of children and the elderly.</p>
<h4>€FINLI€</h4>
<p>The <b>[pl]</b>, plural of <b>°FINLI°</b>, were the three goddesses of fate. Indo-European parallels are plentiful - the grc@Μοῖραι=Moîrai, the lat@Parcae etc. They are described as visiting a child on the third night after birth to decide on his future and are often depicted with a spindle. Their names, [past], [present] and [future], are, per §ie_poetry_myth, possible not entirely native and may be calques from Graeco-Roman influence. Unique to the <b>[pl]</b> within the Indo-European landscape, however, is the important association with spiders, which is a rather insignificant stretch from the metaphorical weaving of threads of life into a web, which is present in other branches.</p>
<!-- Indo-European parallels are obvious, past/present/future as names (classical influence?), they arrive on the third day of birth, spindle/thread etc, idiomatic usage of "writing fate/destiny", spiders as divine animals (< web < thread) -->

<h2>Mythology</h2>
<h3>Origin story</h3>
<p>When the universe came into being, there was a single entity in the world: Time as a baby. As he grew, he gave birth to a Tree, a simple seedling. Floating around in Time, it wanted to grow more but couldn't and decided to bear fruit. She made four apples: one from silver, one from gold, one from copper and one from ivory. From these apples, €SKYDADDY€, €EARTHMUMMY€, €SUNGOD€ and €MOONGOD€ sprung out. [?]</p>
<h3>Foundation war</h3>
<p>Originally, the two divine families - €SKYDADDY€'s and €SUNGOD€'s - lived separately in the divine realm. €AURORA€ was bethroted to her brother, €HADES€, while €PERKUNAS€ had been trying to seduce €PROINA€ and convincing her father to let him marry her. After gaining approval, he tasks his brothers, the divine twins €HORSETWIN1€ and €HORSETWIN2€, to go steal her. When they arrive at €SKYDADDY€'s family, they first see €AURORA€, thinking it is who they are looking for, and are instantly enamoured. They decide to steal her and keep her to themselves.</p>
<p>When the twins fail to return, chaos ensues as €SUNGOD€'s family is accused of stealing the wrong daughter while €SKYDADDY€'s family is accused of having broken the pact and keeping the twins. While the theomachy grows out of control, the twins are enjoying life elsewhere with €AURORA€ and entirely surprised when they return and find everyone fighting. With €AURORA€ declaring her undying love for the twins and her intention to live with them, €SKYDADDY€ gives in and allows the twins to marry €AURORA€ while €PERKUNAS€ is reunited with €PROINA€ and marries her. €HADES€, outrageous about his parents having broken their promise about €AURORA€'s bethrotement, goes into self-exile in the underworld.</p>
<p>The Carite foundation war quite neatly corresponds to stories we find in Norse and Roman sources, where we have the Æsir fight the Vanir until the three fertility deities join the side of the Æsir and where we have the rape of the Sabines. In all three stories, we deal with a social world run by the first two functions which forcefully incorporates the third function, which is fertility. We may also identify the same pattern in the Trojan War, where Helen fulfills the third function, and in Indic mythology, where the Aśvins represent the third function and forcefully infiltrate the world of the other gods.</p>
<h3>Discovery of Immortality</h3>
<p>As is common in the Indo-European tradition, deities are only immortal thanks to a specific food or beverage they consume. In Carite mythology, €PERKUNAS€ is tasked with finding the elusive °BLOODSERP°, a three-headed serpent known to be immortal. When he finds it at the bottom of a whirlpool, he binds it [?]</p>
<p>From an Indo-European point of view, this myth appears to combine two essential myths: the serpent-slaying myth, in which a thunder god slays a serpent or dragon, and the binding of evil, in which a god inserts their hand into an evil being's orifice and loses it. Dumézil's "cycle of the mead" also seems to be relevant, with the magical beverage (being blood rather than mead here), the involvement of a serpent (what about the gods vs demons?).</p>
<h3>Birth of mankind</h3>
<p>€PERKUNAS€ and €PROINA€ have a hermaphrodite self-reproducing child from which all humans come into being [?]</p>
<h3>Acquisition of fire</h3>
<p>A long time ago, the mastery of fire was limited to the gods. In the mortal realm, fire manifested in oaks, traditionally as €PERKUNAS€' doing, but could not be exploited by man. <!--As punishment, €PAN€ was banished from the divine realm and tasked with watching over mankind to make sure their usage of fire was responsible for eternity.

Pan looks over mankind
> "your cattle dies in winter and is eaten by wolves!"
> teaches fire, despite only being for the deities
> gods get pissed, banished from the divine realm

<h3>Heyra</h3>
<p>Heyra [?]</p>
<h3>Moon goddess</h3>
<p>Moon goddess & hero, awards potion [?]</p>
<h3>Final battle</h3>
<p>A large scale battle that means the end of the world as mankind knows it is foretold. It involves the revenge of €HADES€, who had been plotting his revenge against the deities in the divine realm ever since the foundation war. While €LEXY€ is absent, he returns to the other deities in a disguise before overthrowing the head couple, killing €SUNGOD€ (which in turn blinds €LEXY€ [?]) and slashing €MOONGOD€ (explaining the shape of a crescent moon). With no sun to light and warm the world, all €AURORA€ can do is provide a faint twilight every day, plunging the world into a harsh winter. While €HADES€ exploits the deities and enjoys his time on the throne, a blind and lost €LEXY€, following the last visions of €HADES€ murdering her father, lifts the spell which sealed €IGNIS€ before succumbing. Upon seeing the fiery deity return to the realm, he flees back to his hideout - intending on avenging their fallen ancestors, the surviving gods chase him, resulting into cataclysmic battle between the deities and €HADES€ and his adherents. The battle is described to be so severe that all of humanity shall perish. While €IGNIS€ ultimately leads his faction to victory, fulfilling his destiny as their leader and heir to the trone, it is not elaborated on what happens after the battle.</p>
<p>Like the foundation war, the final battle in Carite mirrors the Indo-European eschatological myth. It was later equated to the Christian end time, leading to €IGNIS€'s equation to Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>After the reconquest of the Carites, the importance of the Carite beliefs faded and Christianity quickly took over through <i>interpretatio christiana</i>. Traces of mythology remain in expressions, idioms and folkloric themes while several old deities had their name Latinised and were repainted as saints.</p>
