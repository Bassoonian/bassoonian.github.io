<h1>Orthography</h1>
<p>Despite being relatively limited in size, the corpus of §lang_3 was written in two different scripts.</p>
<h2>Latin</h2>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>In some cases we find a writen <<u>> which was presumably not pronounced. It resulted from word-final §lang_2 /u/, which never surfaces in §lang_4, unlike the originally nasal /ũ/, which did surface as /u/. For this reason, presumably unpronounced word-final <<u>> is specifically marked using a breve in the modernised notation, i.e. <<ŭ>>.</p>
<h2>Arabic</h2>
