<h1>Orthography</h1>
<p>Despite being relatively limited in size, the corpus of §lang_3 was written in two different scripts.</p>
<h2>Latin</h2>
<p>In many ways, the way §lang_3 was written continues several conventions from §lang_2. However, several changes have occurred, mostly resulting from the phonological evolution of the Vulgar Latin most educated speakers were also fluent in, as well as some minor influence from Gothic.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>/m n/ were simply represented as <<m n>>, while /ŋ/ was written as <<ng>>, resulting in orthographic ambiguity regarding intervocalic /ŋ ng/. /p b t d/ were also fairly straightforwardly conveyed through <<p b t d>>. The velar plosives /k g/, on the other hand, were conveyed in different ways depending on the environment. In most cases, they were conveyed through <<c g>>. However, before front vowels, these sounds had palatalised in Vulgar Latin in the fifth century. However, due to the loss of the labial element of Classical Latin /kʷ gʷ/ in the same position, the sequences <<qu gu>> became used for /k g/ before front vowels and this usage was likewise integrated into §lang_3, at least before written <<e i>>. The Carite clusters /kw gw/, which also occurred before front vowels, came to be written <<qu gu>>, with the former being written as <<cu>> before front vowels.</p>
<p>With Classical Latin /w/ having shifted into /β/ before §lang_2 and now §lang_3 having merged /β v/ into a single /v/, the voicing distinction of /f v/ no longer needed to be conveyed by doubling graphemes but could rather simply be conveyed using <<f v>>. /s/ was simply conveyed through <<s>>. The new phoneme /z/ mostly occurred intervocalically, where it did not contrast with /s/, and was as such represented through <<s>> there as well. The two phonemes only contrasted word-finally, where a presumably unpronounced prop vowel <<a>> was added onto the end in the case of /z/, giving it an intervocalic appearance - indeed, in most of the cases where we find word-final /z/, it was followed by a now-lost /a/. /θ x/, which were the result of original aspirates, were written the way they were before, i.e. <<th ch>>. /ð ɣ/, which only contrasted with /d g/ at word boundaries, were simply conveyed through <<d g>> - in modernised versions, as in §lang_2, their fricative nature is indicated through a dot, i.e. <<ḍ ġ>>.</p>
<p>The remaining sounds are relatively straightforward. The liquids /r l/ were simply conveyed through <<r l>>, while the glide /j/ was written as if a vowel, i.e. <<i>>. /w/ was generally conveyed similarly through its vowel equivalent, <<u>>, but in some cases is written as <<y>>. More specifically, this appeared to occur next to /u/ as long as it did not follow a velar plosive. This rather unexpected convention is presumably a remnant of Gothic influence, which employed <<𐍅>> for /w/ in all positions. All geminates were conveyed by doubling their graph, while palatalisation was simply conveyed by adding an <<i>> after the consonant in question.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>With an identical vowel inventory to §lang_2, many of the conventions regarding writing vowels remained, albeit some minor orthographic changes occurred as a result of Gothic influence. The short vowels /a e i o u/ were very simply conveyed as <<a e i o u>>. It is unclear if short /æ ø y/ remained separate phonemes or not, which is why the §lang_2 notation of modernised <<ə ê î>> was retained, while they were authentically merged into <<e e i>>. Regarding long vowels, /aː eː/ were not distinguished from their short equivalents in §lang_3 times, leading to the usage of a macron in modernised depictions, i.e. <<ā ē>>. /iː/ started being written as <<ei>> through the Gothic usage of <<𐌴𐌹>> for the same sound. The usage of <<au>> for /oː/, which was already present in §lang_2, was presumably inforced by the same Gothic convention in <<𐌰𐌿>>. /uː yː/ retained their conventions from §lang_2 in <<ou ui>>. Finally, the §lang_2 depiction of /æː/ as <<ae>> was changed into <<ai>>, presumably due to Gothic's <<𐌰𐌹>> for /ɛ(ː)/, with /øː/ being changed analogically from <<oe>> into <<oi>>.</p>
<p>In some cases we find a writen <<u>> which was presumably not pronounced. It resulted from word-final §lang_2 /u/, which never surfaces in §lang_4, unlike the originally nasal /ũ/, which did surface as /u/. For this reason, presumably unpronounced word-final <<u>> is specifically marked using a breve in the modernised notation, i.e. <<ŭ>>. As expected, no distinction between <<u v>> existed back in §lang_3 times, and as such, they were both conveyed as if <<v>>.</p>
