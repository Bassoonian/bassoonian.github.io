<h1>Phonology</h1>
<p>Despite the existence of a small corpus with three different orthographies, reconstructing the phonology of §lang_3 is rather difficult and the inventories show significant differences between authors.</p>

<p>The main development of the consonant inventory since §lang_2 is clearly the phonemicisation of a separate palatalised series, but also includes the loss of bilabial fricatives, the spirantisation of aspirates and resulting expansion of the fricative inventory and the phonemicisation of /ŋ/.</p>
<p>While the categorisation of most consonants into plain and palatalised is a common take, it is not uncontested. After all, some prefer to consider the word-internal cases as mere sequences /Cj/ and not to consider them as separate phonemes. Likewise, a minority believes that word-finally, the palatalisation-causing vowel remained pronounced and any palatalisation would not be phonemic. There is some proof in favour of a palatalsed approach however: in some attestations written in the Arabic script, we find glyphs for pharyngealised consonants where a plain obstruent is preceded by a front vowel in Carite; it is likely this is indicative of a slightly velarised pronunciation of plain consonants before front vowels to have a clearer contrast with the palatalised series.</p>

<p>With nasal vowels gone, the §lang_3 vowel inventory has shrunk significantly. While we are relatively sure on the long vowels, the short vowels /æ ø y/ form more of a mystery since they are not distinguished orthographically and merge into their orthographic equivalents /e e i/ n §lang_4 times. As such, they may have been pronounced as [e e i] in §lang_3 times already.</p>
<h2>Phonotactics</h2>
||PHONOTACTICS||
<h2>Suprasegmentals</h2>
<p>The analysis of stress varies, but the one presented here is the most common. Stress is always penultimate, unless the antepenultimate syllable has a coda, in which case that syllable receives stress instead. Apparent violations can easily be explained through the presence of an additional empty syllable, which causes final or, per the rules above, potentially penultimate stress instead.</p>
<h2>Morphophonology</h2>
<p>Besides an active regressive voicing assimilation filter, we may find the collapse of two identical vowels into a single long vowel of the same quality, i.e. |V₁V₁(ː)| /V₁ː/. Intervocalic |d g| always surfaced as /ð ɣ/.</p>
