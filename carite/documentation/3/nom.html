<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<p>Very few notorious developments happened in terms of nominal morphology from §lang_2 to §lang_3. The two most important changes are the loss of the locative as distinct case, as well as the full merger of the acrostatic nominals into thematic neuters.</p>
<h2>Thematic Nominals</h2>
<h3>Masculine</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-6">||TABLE-OS_UNSTRESSED_DEF||</div>
		<div class="col-6">||TABLE-OS_UNSTRESSED_DEF_EXON||</div>
	</div>
</div>
<h4>Alpha</h4>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-6">||TABLE-OS_UNSTRESSED_ALPH||</div>
		<div class="col-6">||TABLE-OS_UNSTRESSED_ALPH_EXON||</div>
	</div>
</div>
<h3>Feminine</h3>
<p>Feminine thematics had lost their delta and alpha distinction, generalising the alpha forms for nouns, but the delta forms for adjectives.</p>
