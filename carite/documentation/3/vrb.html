<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<p>Some verbs with irregular preterite stems, generally stemming from old Proto-Indo-European statives, underwent reanalysis and backformation, yielding regular preterites to the existing present stems and new present stems form the old preterites. Only few retain the stem alteration.</p>
<h2>Thematic</h2>
<p>The alpha rho variants, which mostly differed in the subjunctive, completely merged into the regular alpha thematics.</p>

<h2>Vocalic</h2>
<h3>Transitive</h3>
<p>Back in §lang_2, the preterite had two deviant forms. The first person singular was nasalised and was, as a result of that, shortened, while the second person singular was lengthened. These two forms merged by §lang_3 times, both yielding a zero suffix. This development has been researched in numerous papers and the general consensus is as follows. Regarding the first person, the loss of nasalisation yielded a short vowel that often differed from the original stem. Most vocalic transitive verbs had a stem ending on a long vowel, which means that the second person was in almost all cases identical to the bare stem. From this point of view, it would only make sense to undo the lengthening if the vowel of the stem was short in all other forms. The subsequent development of the deviant first person singular form would then be straightforward as the stem from other forms would be generalised onto it, with an identical second person singular form only enforcing this influence.</p>
