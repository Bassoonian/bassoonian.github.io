<h2>Latin</h2>
<p>Any changes mentioned here that had occurred to Classical Latin since the beginning of §lang_2 are omitted here. Please refer to the relevant chapter for more information.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>By the fifth century, two key processes in the evolution of Latin had taken place: the palatalisation of velars before front velars (as well as /kj/) and the spirantisation, voicing and degemination of plosives. For example, °ENEMY° reflects lat@inimīcus.</p>
<p>°BREINA°, reflecting the Late lat@brigna, shows the Late Latin realisation of /gn/ as /ɲ/; this sound was alien to the §lang_3 speakers, who unpacked it into the cluster /nj/.</p>
