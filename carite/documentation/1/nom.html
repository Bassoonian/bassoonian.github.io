<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<p>The nominal morphology of §lang_1 in many ways faithfully reflects distinctions made in §lang_0; as such, the usual four classes - thematic, iotic, nasal and acrostatic - are reconstructed at this point in time. Likewise, the etymological distinction between radical and oxytonic paradigms remained; however, they were significantly repurposed. As the majority of all nouns took radical endings and most adjectives took oxytonic suffixes, these paradigms were reanalysed as being substantival and adjectival, respectively. Adjectives may occasionally take substantival endings; however, this only occurs if they function as a noun in the sentence.</p>
<p>The conjunctive clitic from §lang_0 had become morphologised as sound laws rendered the bare clitic form opaque. The usage presumably remained identical, as we find a similar usage in both the §lang_0 attestations and those found after. One may postulate four general tendencies, although these are unsufficient to correctly predict all suffixes: the application of Osthoff's Law, the denasalisation and insertion of <i>*m</i> for word-final nasal vowels, which resulted in the allomorph <i>*-pe</i>, the etymological retention of word-final <i>*s</i> which had either turned into <i>*ḫ</i> or was lost and induced compensatory lengthening, and the alteration between bare <i>*-V̄̃s</i> and conjunctive <i>*-Vnte</i>.</p>
<p>As we are unable to find any vocative are ablative forms after the §lang_0 period, they are generally reconstructed to have been lost in §lang_1 times. The absorption of the vocative by the nominative is a given, considering their incredibly morphological similarity, while the ablative appears to have been usurped by the dative case.</p>
<h2>Thematic Nominals</h2>
<p>The terminology of this category differs wildly, with some continuing their etymological terms - o-stems and a-stems - and others simply classifying them as subdivisions of a single nominal category.</p>

<p>The differences between the substantival and adjectival inflections are minimal. In the masculine and neuter paradigms, we find a u-vocalism on several occasions, more precisely in the dative and instrumental singular as well as in the genitive and instrumental plural. The differences for the feminine paradigm consist of the locative singular and the genitive plural.</p>
