<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Developments</h2>
<p>The nominal morphology of §lang_1 in many ways faithfully reflects distinctions made in §lang_0; as such, the usual four classes - thematic, iotic, nasal and acrostatic - are reconstructed at this point in time. Likewise, the etymological distinction between radical and oxytonic paradigms remained; however, they were significantly repurposed. As the majority of all nouns took radical endings and most adjectives took oxytonic suffixes, these paradigms were reanalysed as being substantival and adjectival, respectively. Adjectives may occasionally take substantival endings; however, this only occurs if they function as a noun in the sentence.</p>
<p>The conjunctive clitic from §lang_0 had become morphologised as sound laws rendered the bare clitic form opaque. The usage presumably remained identical, as we find a similar usage in both the §lang_0 attestations and those found after. One may postulate four general tendencies, although these are unsufficient to correctly predict all suffixes: the application of Osthoff's Law, the denasalisation and insertion of <i>*m</i> for word-final nasal vowels, which resulted in the allomorph <i>*-pe</i>, the etymological retention of word-final <i>*s</i> which had either turned into <i>*ḫ</i> or was lost and induced compensatory lengthening, and the alteration between primary <i>*-V̄̃s</i> and conjunctive <i>*-Vnte</i>.</p>
<p>As we are unable to find any vocative are ablative forms after the §lang_0 period, they are generally reconstructed to have been lost in §lang_1 times. The absorption of the vocative by the nominative is a given, considering their incredibly morphological similarity, while the ablative appears to have been usurped by the dative case.</p>
<h2>Thematic Nominals</h2>
<p>The terminology of this category differs wildly, with some continuing their etymological terms - o-stems and a-stems - and others simply classifying them as subdivisions of a single nominal category.</p>
<h3>Masculine</h3>
||TABLE-OS_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h3>Feminine</h3>
||TABLE-AA_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h3>Neuter</h3>
||TABLE-OM_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h3>Adjectival</h3>
||TABLE-ADJ_THEM_STRESSED_DEF||
<p>The differences between the substantival and adjectival inflections are minimal. In the masculine and neuter paradigms, we find a u-vocalism on several occasions, more precisely in the dative and instrumental singular as well as in the genitive and instrumental plural. The differences for the feminine paradigm consist of the locative singular and the genitive plural.</p>
<h2>Iotic Nominals</h2>
<h3>Masculine</h3>
||TABLE-IS_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h3>Feminine</h3>
||TABLE-II_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h3>Neuter</h3>
||TABLE-I_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<p>An unetymological nasalisation of the nominative and accusative singular suffix presumably took time around this period, almost undoubtedly through analogy with the thematic neuters.</p>
<h3>Adjectival</h3>
||TABLE-ADJ_I_STRESSED||
<p>As is the case for the thematics, the differences between substantival and adjectival inflections are minimal. More specifically, the dative singular, and genitive plural forms differ.</p>
<h2>Nasal Nominals</h2>
<h3>Masculine</h3>
||TABLE-MO_DEF||
<h3>Neuter</h3>
||TABLE-MUN_DEF||
<p>The genitive singular presumably replaced an older <i>**-enē</i> after the genitive singular of the acrostatics; please see below.</p>
<h2>Acrostatic Nominals</h2>
||TABLE-ESOS_UNSTRESSED_DEF||
<h2>Degrees of comparison</h2>
<h3>Comparative</h3>
||TABLE-COMPARATIVE||
<p>Due to its unique inflection pattern, the comparative degree does not distinguish between adjectival and substantival usage.</p>
<h3>Superlative</h3>
||TABLE-SUPERLATIVE||
<p>Besides the adjectival table presented above, superlatives could also take thematic substantival endings.</p>
<h2>Numerals</h2>
<h3>One</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-NUM_ONE||</div>
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The numeral for one cleanly follows a thematic inflection with a single caveat: it does not decline like an adjective.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<h3>Two</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>The irregular inflection of the numeral for two remains. The coalescence of <i>*dw</i> to <i>*b</i>, which was limited to environments with a front vowel, presumably orginally only affected half the paradigm, with the generalisation of this stem having been the result of analogy.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-NUM_TWO||</div>
	</div>
</div>
<h3>Three</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-4">||TABLE-NUM_THREE||</div>
		<div class="col-8">
			<p>As in §lang_0, the reconstructed inflection table for the numeral for three is closely related to the iotic adjectives. However, we find several long vowels that were shortened in polysyllabic adjectives.</p>

<h2>Pronouns</h2>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<h4>First and second</h4>
<p>We find significant analogy in the plural forms between the tonic and atonic forms. It is unclear to which degree the atonic forms remained in use and if the conjunctive forms also made a distinction between tonic and atonic forms.</p>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-6">
			<p>In the first person pronouns, we find two main developments, both in the plural forms. First of all, all forms on <i>*in-</i> appear to have been outright replaced by the stems on <i>*a-</i>. Additionally, the initial nasal of the atonic forms seems to have spread to the tonic forms. It is unclear which development took place first - perhaps the intrusion of the initial nasal motivated the dissimilatory replacement of the old forms on <i>*in-</i>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-6">||TABLE-PRON_PERS_1||</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-6">||TABLE-PRON_PERS_2||</div>
		<div class="col-6">
			<p>While the first person plural pronouns underwent generalisation of one of the tonic forms, no such analogy was necessary for the second person pronouns, which did not undergo any sort of alteration. However, the initial <i>*w</i> - eventually <i>*ḫ</i> - did spread from the atonic forms to the tonic forms.</p>
