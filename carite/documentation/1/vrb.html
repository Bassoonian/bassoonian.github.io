<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>We are unable to pinpoint any exact morphological developments of the verbal system until the next post-§lang_1 attestations, so the system presented here will match the system reconstructed for §lang_0.</p>
<h2>Transitive conjugations</h2>
<h3>Thematic</h3>
||TABLE-OH2_DEF||
<p>It is generally postulated that the first person ending in the subjunctive non-past, which should regularly have given <i>**-o</i>, was relengthened later through analogy with the rest of the subjunctive; the fact such lengthening did not take place in the past forms is an often cited argument in favour of allophonic length in nasal vowels.</p>
<p>The predictability of the future stems has been reduced significantly compared to §lang_0 times, with sound changes clouding many of the originally visible processes. However, several tendencies may be noted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Stems ending on <i>*s</i> tend to share a single stem for all forms, eg. °EWSO° and <i>*ȳs-</i>;</li>
	<li>Stems ending on <i>*t *d</i> tend to have a future stem on <i>*-s(s)-</i>, depending on the environment, eg. °SWEYDOO° and <i>*sīss-</i> or °PIRTHO° and <i>*pirs-</i>;</li>
	<li>Stems ending on post-vocalic <i>*k *g</i> tend to have a future stem on <i>*-hs-</i>, eg. °STEYKO° and <i>*stīhs-</i>;</li>
	<li>Stems ending on <i>*mp *mb</i> tend to have a future stem on <i>*-V̨m-</i>, eg. °STEMVO° and <i>*stįm-</i>;</li>
	<li>Stems ending on <i>*p *b</i> tend to have a future stem on <i>*-x-</i>, eg. °BIBERE° and <i>*pix-</i>;</li>
	<li>Stems ending on post-vocalic <i>*f *v</i> tend to have a future stem on <i>*-sm-</i>, eg. °TEYVO° and <i>*tīsm-</i>;</li>
	<li>All other stems tend to simply append <i>*-s-</i> to the stem.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that stems that end on <i>*j</i> remove the approximant before deriving a future stem, eg. °LUUKJO° and <i>*lȳhs-</i>.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
||TABLE-OH2_DEF_PFP||
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest uncertainties about §lang_1 is whether the stative preterites continued to possess their own distinct, albeit incredibly similar set of endings. We know that the two paradigms had fully merged by §lang_2 times and that the onsets of the irregular past stems do not show the effects of the augment loss, but it is unsure for how long the endings remained distinct. As such, the §lang_0 endings are hypothetically inherited in this reconstruction, although neither position may be reliably proven.</p>
<h4>Rho variants</h4>
||TABLE-OH2_DEF_SUF||
<p>Previously known as zeta variants, the new terminology is the result of the widespread rhotacism that took place in §lang_1. We find the same analogical lengthening in the subjunctive as in the normal thematic inflection.</p>
<p>The future stem forming principles are similar to the regular thematic formation, albeit slightly different and significantly easier:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Stems ending on <i>*mp *mb</i> tend to have a future stem on <i>*-V̨m-</i>, eg. °LEYKWOO° and <i>*lįm-</i>;</li>
	<li>Stems ending on a consonant preceded by another consonant or a sonorant tend to delete the consonant and append <i>*-r-</i>, eg. °PRIZGUU° and <i>*prirr-</i>;</li>
	<li>All other stems tend to simply append <i>*-r-</i> to the stem.</li>
</ul>
<p>As above, any stem ending on <i>*j</i> disregard the glide in their future derivation, eg. °GUNJUU° and <i>*gunr-</i>.</p>
<h3>Athematic Resonantal</h3>
||TABLE-MI_RES_DEF||
<p>It is worth noting we find forms such as °DIMMI° rather than <i>**dįmi</i>. Since new cases of <i>*VN₁N₁</i> became phonemic again after the nasalisation in such environments, it is likely these forms were reanalogised back into the primary stem.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
||TABLE-MI_RES_DEF_PFP||
<h3>Athematic Vocalic</h3>
||TABLE-MI_VOC_DEF||
<p>The loss of word-final post-vocalic consonants such as nasals and §lang_0 <i>*-s</i> caused several predictable alterations to affect the stem in athematic vocalics, more specifically in the preterite. For example, in the first person, we find nasalisation of the now word-final vowel (from §lang_0 <i>*-m</i>) and in the second person, the suffix depends on the vowel - if a non-back vowel, it is lengthened if not already long; if a back vowel, the suffix is <i>*-ḫ</i>. For this reason, it is sometimes argued that morphophonologically, the suffix is always <i>*-ḫ</i>, which would word-finally be lost and cause compensatory lengthening when following a non-back vowel.</p>
<p>A handful of verbs had a subjunctive stem ending on a vowel in §lang_0, and feature an additional alteration in the subjunctive, with either <i>*j</i> or <i>*w</i> being inserted depending on the first vowel of the suffix.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
||TABLE-MI_VOC_DEF_PFP||
<h2>Intransitive conjugations</h2>
<h3>Thematic</h3>
||TABLE-OR_DEF||
<p>Here, too, we find the analogical lengthening of the first person suffix in the subjunctive. The future stem rules follow the same principles as is the case for the transitive conjugations.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
||TABLE-OR_DEF_PFP||
<p>Unlike the transitive conjugation, where the stative preterite endings were incredibly similar to the regular preterite endings, no such thing was the case for the intransitives. As such, we may posit with slightly more certainty that the suffixes remained distinct at this stage.</p>
<h4>Rho variants</h4>
||TABLE-OR_DEF_SUF||
<p>Here, too, we find analogical lengthening. The future stem principles are identical to the transitive ones.</p>
<h3>Athematic Resonantal</h3>
||TABLE-OR_RES_DEF||
<p>The future first person, where we would expect <i>**-asjo</i>, was reformed into <i>*-asīwo</i> through analogy with the thematic paradigm.</p>
<h4>Stative preterites</h4>
