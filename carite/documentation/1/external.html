<h1>External Interactions</h1>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>In the roughly 450 years of timespan between §lang_0 and what is often considered to be the ending point of §lang_1, the Carites moved significantly further west, presumably crossing the Pyrenees early on. Considering there are no attestations, contact with external languages is generally used as a reference in an attempt to situate the migration pattern, although this method is not waterproof. It is worth noting that §lang_1's non-phonemic initial stress took precedence over any other stress patterns from other languages it drew vocabulary from.</p>
<h2>Ancient Greek</h2>
<p>Extensive contact with Ancient Greek continued, although we may no longer date any Doric loans from this stage. It is likely that this is the result of the departure from the seaside, which sealed them off from the Mediterranean trade network. It is of interest that in later Greek loans, we may see the first effects of the Koineization of the Greek colonies on the Franco-Spanish mainland. All loans of Greek origin show changes such as the liquid metathesis, which means that it is likely contact with the Greek colonies was lost before this time, or possibly that the Greek colonies ceased being Hellenophone by this time.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>While °GRCAMPHORA°, which reflects grc@ἀμφορεύς=amphoreús, is sometimes cited as source of a lack of early spirantisation of Greek, a hypothetical <i>**amforih</i> would have undergone the regular fortition of post-nasal fricatives. Likewise, the borrowing of grc@θάλασσα=thálassa as °GRCSEA° and of grc@μάραθον=márathon as °GRCMARATHOM° may either point towards an original aspiration, which was lost in the borrowing process, or the closest approximation of /θ/. Nonetheless, other sources clearly point towards the Greek spirantisation being a Common Era development - for more information, please consult §grcdialects§.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>The borrowing of grc@δοῦλος=doûlos as °GRCDOULOS° may seem odd at a first sight, but is representative of the sound changes Greek went through following the fifth century BC, which included the raising of /oː/ to /uː/. The borrowing of grc@ἐλαίᾱ=elaíā as °GRCOLIVE° means it must without a doubt have preceded the collapse of Greek /ai̯/ to /ɛː/, which is dated to around 100 BC. However, it is possible the word was loaned during its intermediate stage /æː/, in which case this sound foreign to §lang_1 could have been broken into a diphthong that happens to coincide with its original value. °SIDEROSIRON° clearly reflects grc@σίδηρος=sídēros, with the high vowel rather than the mid vowel being indicative of the gradual fronting of /ɛː/, presumably yielding a vowel closer to §lang_1 /iː/ rather than /eː/ at the time of the borrowing. grc@κεράσιον=kerásion being borrowed as °GRCCHERRY° shows the reduction of /iV/ to /jV/ post-consonantally. The status of Ancient Greek /y(ː)/ as [y(ː)] rather than later [i(ː)] is proven by °GLASS° from grc@ὕᾰλος=húalos and °GRCSUKU° from grc@σῦκον=sûkon, respectively. As seen in the former example, a hiatus was resolved as it was no longer phonotactically allowed in §lang_1 times.</p>
<h2>Gaulish</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the ancient Carites had a considerable amount of contact with the surrounding Gauls, leading to a significant amount of words of Gaulish origin. These included trivial words, but presumably also the months of the Celtic calendar - after all, many of the later pagan Carite holidays are etymologically derivable from the Coligny calendar. The relative uncertainty regarding details of Gaulish as a language are not particularly helpful here, but we may posit some Gaulish phonological takes based on loans into Carite.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>The Gaulish consonant inventory was mostly a subset of §lang_1's, making loans particularly straightforward. Where Gaulish contained /x/ or /h/ preconsonantally, represented as <<x>>, Carite borrowed a plain /h/, no matter the vowel's height. As such, °ANEHTLOM° reflects gal@anextlo-. Loans into §lang_1 are of no help in determining the exact pronunciation of the <i>tau gallicum</i> as no loans appear to have contained this sound.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>The base five-vowel inventory /a e i o u/ Gaulish possessed was borrowed straightforwardly into §lang_1. Vowel length is not written, but at least several loans into Carite contain a long vowel, such as °EDRINJOS° from gal@aedrini- or gal@edrini-, where it is likely the opening vowel was likewise long in Gaulish. Some original Gaulish diphthongs were reduced in their Carite loans, such as °RIWROS° reflecting gal@riuros, which was extended with an additional palatal approximant in analogy with the other months and possibly had Osthoff's Law applied afterwards.</p>
<h2>Latin</h2>
<p>By 50 BC, generally considered to be the end of §lang_1 times, the speakers had at least some contact with the Romans, who had conquered and annexed the Iberian Peninsula bar the most northern section, which would follow shortly afterwards. As such, it is only logical a wide variety of Latin loans start surfacing in §lang_1. This gives Carite the special status of having experienced Latin throughout its development into Vulgar Latin, which it shares with Celtic and Albanian. While only a handful of words may be dated to this period, many more would follow.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>The voiceless consonants in Latin, written as <<p t c>>, respectively, are loaned faithfully: we find °LATHISPANIA° for lat@Hispānia, °LATVITIUM° for lat@vitium and °LATCATTUS° for lat@cattus. Only a single voiced consonant from a Latin word may be found here, /d/, where it is likewise loaned as such, yielding °LATDOLIUM° from lat@dōlium. No words featuring labiovelars may be dated back to this period. The four sonorants /m n l r/ are similarly loaned faithfully, with °LATNUMUS° and °LATLIRA° reflecting the nasals in lat@nūmus and the liquids in lat@līra, respectively. The fricative <<s>> was borrowed as such into Carite, as is evident in the examples above. Whether or not the majority of the Romance knew where to pronounce <<h>> as /h/ remains up to debate, but it is clear that the glottal fricative was borrowed into Carite in °LATHISPANIA°. Finally, we find a reflex of <<v>> as /v/ in °LATVITIUM°, despite the Latin pronuncation not having been [v] at this time and §lang_1 possessing /w/ as phoneme. However, no native Carite words featured /w/ as the onset of the first syllable, so it is likely this was reinterpreted as /v/ in this position.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>The typical five-vowel system /a e i o u/ with contrastive length that Latin possessed was part of §lang_1's inventory and was straightforwardly borrowed as such. Of note, however, is that the phonotactics regarding vowel hiatus was significantly different in Carite, with <i>-ium</i> and <i>-ia</i> sequencese in Latin being reduced to sequences with a plain glide, i.e. <i>*-jǫ</i> and <i>*-ja</i>. Additionally, the continued productivity of Osthoff's Law in Carite meant that several vowels that were originally long in Latin were subsequently shortened.</p>
<h2>Pre-Basque</h2>
<p>A dozen of §lang_1 words may be traced back to a Basque origin, more specifically the Aquitanian equivalent spoken during antiquity. As explained by §ed_basque§, Roman sources indicate the presence of Aquitanians in the area of the historical Basque Country, and the fragments of documentation of this language mostly match the reconstructed phonology of Pre-Basque, which is the name given to the period Basque first began loaning words from Latin. This means that it may be dated to be near contemporary to §lang_1, which also started loaning words from Latin around this period and which resided in a similar area. As such, §lang_1 is sometimes used to help confirm the Pre-Basque reconstructions.</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>To get an understanding of the Pre-Basque consonant system with its fortis and lenis distinction, which is mostly irrelevant to loans in §lang_1, readers are advised to consult §ed_basque§. Regarding the plosive series, we only find a single instance of a Pre-Basque <i>*t</i>, where it may be found in °EUSGAZTANE° from peus@gaztane. More prominent are the voiced plosives, where we find reflexes of Pre-Basque <i>*b *d *g</i> in °EUSIBAR° from peus@ibar, °EUSURDE° from peus@urde and °EUSSAGAR° from peus@sagar, respectively. Despite the fortis and lenis contrast of Pre-Basque <i>*n *N</i>, where we would expect a geminate reflex of <i>*N</i>, we find a simplex nasal in °EUSAINALA° from peus@aiNala, although it is likely any possible loaned gemination would have been neutralised due to the preceding glide; we find °EUSANARI° reflecting the lenis <i>*n</i> from peus@anari. The lamino-alveolar and apico-alveolar distinction in Pre-Basque, usually notated with <i>*z *s</i>, respectively, was neutralised in Carite, both surfacing as a plain §lang_1 <i>*s</i>. As such, both peus@zaldi and peus@sagar are borrowed with a plain <i>*s</i>, yielding °EUSZALDI° and °EUSSAGAR°, respectively. The Pre-Basque sounds written as <i>*tz *ts</i> are not found in any loans from Basque into Carite. While Pre-Basque also featured a fortis-lenis distinction for the liquids, i.e. <i>*R *r</i> and <i>*L *l</i>, only the lenis equivalents appear in loans into Carite; we find °EUSIBAR° from peus@ibar and °EUSAINALA° from peus@aiNala. While Pre-Basque most likely included aspiration to some degree, although unclear if fully contrastive, this feature never surfaces in §lang_1 loans.</p>
<!-- <p>Pre-Basque consonants were considered to be either fortis or lenis, which were neutralised extensively (for more information, please refer to §ed_basque§). For the fortis consonants <i>*p *t *k</i>, we may find the associated lenis series <i>*b *d *g</i> (although the existence of <i>*p</i> is disputed). §ed_basque§'s description of fortis consonants as being long does indeed seem to be reflected: after all, all §lang_1 Pre-Basque loans featuring unvoiced stops have geminates where phonotactically allowed. °ERBI° for peus@erbi. We find °URDE° for peus@urde. °APPLE° for peus@sagar. Likewise, the distinction between <i>*R *r</i> - a trill and a tap, respectively - is borrowed as a geminate and a simple rhotic - if there was an additional distinction in voicing in Pre-Basque, this was lost in §lang_1. As such, we find °ANARI° for peus@anari. The lamino-alveolar and apico-alveolar distinction between the series <i>*tz *z</i> and <i>*ts *s</i> is lost in loans, surfacing as <i>*ts</i> for fortis and <i>*s</i> for lenis, respectively. As such, we find °PIGEON° from peus@urzo. The remaining two sonorant pairs, <i>*N *n</i> and <i>*L *l</i>, had the fortis-lenis distinction borrowed as plain gemination although once again, the phonotactical constraint against non-intervocalic geminates further neutralised this contrast. While Pre-Basque most likely included aspiration to some degree, although unclear if fully contrastive, this feature never surfaces in §lang_1 loans.</p> -->
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>The Pre-Basque vowel system was a typical five-vowel /a e i o u/ inventory. Since §lang_1's vowel inventory included all five, vocalic reflexes of Basque are straightforward; please refer to the examples above. While we are unable to determine if Pre-Basque featured (contrastive) vowel length, all vocalic reflexes into Carite are short. Additionally, vowel sequences gave the diphthongs /ai ei ou au eu/, of which we only find the first in loans into Carite.</p>
