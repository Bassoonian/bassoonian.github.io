<h1>Orthography</h1>
Unlike §lang_0, absolutely zero attestations of §lang_1 exist. As a result, the notation system employed in these reconstructions is entirely artificial in nature.
<h2>Consonants</h2>
<p>The orthography when it comes to consonants is incredibly straightforward with all sounds being portraited with their associated letters. The only exception is /x/, which is written as <<ḫ>> instead. This edition, like many other but not all editions, additionally employs <<x>> for /ks/.</p>
<h2>Vowels</h2>
<p>Vowels are generally conveyed through the sounds they convey, eg. <<a>> for /a/. Rather than <<ø>> and <<y>>, older, mainly German sources employ <<ö>> and <<ü>>, respectively. Since oral vowel length is conveyed through the use of macrons, the more modern approach is employed here. Nasal vowels are indicated through the use of an ogonek, i.e. <<ą>> for /ã/. Since nasal vowel length is not distinctive, no macrons are used here.</p>
