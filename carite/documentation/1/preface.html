<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>Unlike §lang_0, where the few attestations we have allow us to not just reconstruct a somewhat singular language but also certain orthographic conventions, §lang_1 lacks such advantages and is wholly unattested. This means that any attempt to reconstruct an intermediate stage between §lang_0 and the next attestations, roughly a millenium later, are built entirely on internal reconstruction.</p>
<p>§lang_1 is generally reconstructed to have been spoken around 50 BC, although this point is rather arbitrary and different authors may mark the boundaries between the different stages in different ways.</p>
