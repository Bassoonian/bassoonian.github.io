<h2>Conjunctive nominals</h2>
<p>One of the key defining features of Carite is the existence of conjunctive nominals. While these became strongly integrated with morphological alternations later, it is assumed that in §lang_0 times, this function was fulfilled by the single clitic °KWE°. Deriving from pie@-kʷe, where it connected different clauses on the same level, it is likely that it became conflated with the relative pronouns which were very similar. A near-identical usage of conjunctive nominals at this point in time is confirmed by the few attestations we have. More specifically, conjunctive nominals were the default way of introducing subordinate clauses. The word order of a subordinate clause is by default OSV as the first constituent of a subordinate clause must be phrase with a conjunctive nominal (either a noun phrase, or a prepositional phrase). For intransitive verbs, this would be their subject, while for transitives it would be their direct object (prototypically an accusative). This can also be an adpositional phrase, or a non-argument noun phrase in a non-core case with adverbial function; this is usually done for pragmatic topicalisation purposes.</p>
<h2>Adverbs</h2>
<p>§lang_0 did not inherit or innovate any adverbial marker; rather, it employed adjectives predicatively. For example, "quickly" would e.g. be conveyed as "as a quick [person]". This means that the adjective agreed in gender and number with the subject while also taking the nominative case.</p>
