morphology & syntax
===================

You can find all the inflection tables in the full grammar (l4v7.pdf), as well as any details. I'll provide a brief overview:

* a clause usually ends with a verb, and might have head or tail particles
* nouns have case (12 cases) and number (singular / dual / plural); the noun declensions are quite involved, so an inflected form might not look much like its lemma (some certainly defy simple Ctrl+F'ery)
* verbs can be in finite (in the main clause), relative (modifying a noun), or nominalized (acting as a noun) form. The base ("infinitive") form ends with <a> or <i> plus <t>. Relative-form verbs often function as adjectives. Nominalized verbs are just a particle for case + infinitive form, although the two might drift apart slightly.
* verbs can also take coordinate forms (name came from how these forms translate to English; they're technically subordinate à la Japanese -te forms): -(a/i)me = 'and', -(a/i)ge = 'inclusive or'
* verbs are either intransitive (no accusative or dative arg), semitransitive (dative arg), transitive (accusative arg), ditransitive (accusative and dative arg), or auxiliary (works on another verb). A "target" of an auxiliary verb can be elided using <fel>. Pay attention to the argument slots in verb glosses; they don't always match what you think.
* this language has postpositions; they don't inflect, but govern a particular case.
* some modifiers can split away from their heads. Good rule of thumb: if they agree, they can probably drift away from each other, although the order between them can't switch.
* make sure to read the chapter on numerals; nothing can go wrong by knowing about numerals
