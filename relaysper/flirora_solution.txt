Kelexaise the sacred is revered by the people and commands them.
The sacred one says this:
"Xikuasa has punished people for defiance."
Every hot summer, you give one-eighth of your money to Xikuasa, and you give bags of wheat to Xikuasa.
Or you give them two ships with soldiers to wage war with Kelexaikise.
You give bags to Xikuasa or continue doing so.
