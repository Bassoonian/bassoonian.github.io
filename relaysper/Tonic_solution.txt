"When Kíilsagsi was named"

I heard a god that together with the elders trusted the letters of poetry.
Ágkagi was burdened with a good day.
When the two armies had assembled the soldiers of Kíilsagsi on the battlefield,
they bought a lot of beer with eight silver coins.
The entertainment of a group does not come from friends.
Thus, they might've bought beer with a lot of silver coins.
